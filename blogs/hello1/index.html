Abstract—Platoon communications in vehicular networks is
considered to have broad application prospects in improving
road capacity and traffic safety. This paper considers a multiplatoon vehicle scenario, in which platoon vehicles (PVs)
transmit cooperative awareness messages (CAMs) to other PVs
in the same platoon. The leader platoon vehicles (L-PVs)
use dedicated resource blocks (RBs) to communicate with the
base station (BS) and broadcast their CAMs to their member
platoon vehicles (M-PVs). Meanwhile, to increase spectral efficiency and satisfy the communication demands of PVs, we allow
M-PVs to reuse RBs with each other to transmit their CAMs.
Finally, due to the fact that traditional graph can only model
pairwise relations, we utilize hypergraph to model relationship
among several users and propose a Hypergraph-based Resource
Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) scheme
for multi-platoon scenario. Simulation results illustrate that
the proposed scheme shows a better performance in terms of
spectral efficiency and sum data rate when compared with
traditional graph coloring algorithm and random selection
scheme.

I. Introduction
In vehicle-to-everything communications, platoon is considered to be one of the most representative fifth-generation
(5G) use cases, which can enhance traffic efficiency [1].
To support the synchronous control of the platoon, all
platoon vehicles (PVs) should maintain the same speed and
a constant inter-vehicle distance to ensure string stability [2]
[3], which makes the spacing and velocity error of platoon
would not be amplified with the downstream of the platoon. Therefore, it is essential to transmit their cooperative
awareness messages (CAMs) to other PVs. CAMs include
messages about the driving strategy of the platoon such
as speed and acceleration, as well as information about
resource scheduling within the platoon [1]. According to

communication structure of PVs, there are three main control
strategies, i.e., predecessor following control (PFC) strategy,
symmetric bidirectional control (SBC) strategy, predecessorleader following control (PLFC) strategy [4] [5]. Among
them, the PLFC strategy is a major approach, which shows
outstanding performance in improving string stability [5].
Specifically, each member platoon vehicle (M-PV) communicates with the leader platoon vehicle (L-PV) and the
adjacent PV in front of it to ensure string stability.
When PVs transmit their CAMs, they need to occupy
a certain amount of spectrum resources to realize predefined communication quality, e.g., the minimum data rate
requirements. In face of limited spectrum resources, reusing
spectrum is a promising way to enhance spectral efficiency,
which however introduces more interference among vehicles.
In this case, allocating spectrum resources reasonably is critical to improve communication delay and network capacity.
The authors in [6] jointly considered the platoon size and
power consumption of the platoon, and designed a twostep resource allocation strategy based on branch and bound
algorithm. Works in [7] proposed a time division-based
intra-platoon and minimum rate guaranteed inter-platoon
resource allocation mechanisms to allocate resources for
D2D users efficiently within the platoon. However, the joint
optimization problem of resource allocation and interference
management for multi-platoon scenario has not been well
studied.
The traditional graph can tackle the interference problem,
and the ordinary edges can model pairwise relations, which
however is not sufficient in modeling cumulative interference
in wireless networks. Hypergraph is a useful tool to tackle
this challenge, and it has been applied widely in recent
years [8] [9], since the hyperedges in hypergraph can take
into account the cumulative interference from several users.
Specifically, hypergraph coloring algorithm is an approximate and efficient method for resource allocation problem,
in which users can be modeled as vertices, and the interference relationship among multi-users can be constructed
as hyperedges, RBs can be constructed as different colors
[8] [10]. The authors in [11] used a weighted three-partite
interference hypergraph (IHG) to imitate the complex interference and put forward an IHG-based three-dimensional
matching resource allocation protocol. Meanwhile, works
in [12] proposed a hypergraph spectral clustering based

method in non-orthogonal multiple access heterogeneous
network to deal with the serious cumulative interference.
However, at the time of writing, there is no work invoking
the hypergraph coloring algorithm to address the resource
allocation problem in multi-platoon scenario.
Motivated by above discussions, this paper focuses on
resource allocation and interference management in multiplatoon scenario based on hypergraph coloring algorithm.
Main contributions are summarized as follows. Firstly, we
consider a multi-platoon scenario and formulate an optimization problem to maximize the spectral efficiency of
all M-PVs in the scenario. Then we propose a resource
allocation and interference management scheme for multiplatoon based on hypergraph coloring algorithm to solve the
problem. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the
proposed scheme in terms of spectral efficiency and sum
date rate.
II. System Model And Problem Formulation
In this section, we first describe the multi-platoon scenario along with the channel model. Then, we formulate a
general resource allocation problem to maximize the spectral
efficiency for the whole network.
A. System Model
We consider a multi-platoon scenario consisting of M
platoons on a fixed road segment, as shown in Fig. 1. The
i-th platoon is denoted by Vi. The number of PVs in each
platoon is the same, which is denoted by K, and the PVs
in Vi are denoted by Vi = {v1i, v2i, &hellip;, vji, &hellip;, vKi i}. Among
them, v1i is the L-PV and vji is the j-th PV of platoon Vi.
The licensed spectrum is divided into multiple RBs with
unit bandwidth, which can be reused by M-PVs. The MPVs reusing the same RBs are grouped into a cluster, and
the clusters are denoted by R= {r1, r2, &hellip;, rN}. Without
loss of generality, we apply the PLFC strategy in this work,
and give detailed discussions on its two main transmission
processes.</p>
<ol>
<li>Broadcast process: Firstly, the L-PVs not only need
to receive the information from the BS, such as resource
scheduling messages, but also need to transmit their CAMs
to BS. The corresponding communication links are denoted
with red and orange dotted arrows in Fig. 1. Then L-PVs
broadcast their CAMs to their M-PVs. Due to the broadcast
range is limited, the L-PVs might not be able to cover the
entire platoon in the broadcast process.</li>
<li>V2V communications process: Once the process of the
broadcast is completed, each M-PV will start transmitting its
own CAMs to the adjacent M-PV behind it, the corresponding communication links are denoted with the blue arrow
in Fig. 1. We apply Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD)
mechanism so that M-PVs can transmit and receive CAMs
using different RBs simultaneously. Meanwhile, different
M-PVs can share RBs within controllable interference. By
assuming that each M-PV occupies a dedicated RB, they can
reuse the RBs of all members when they are grouped into
one cluster. For example, three M-PVs in the same cluster
can reuse three RBs simultaneously.
B. Channel Models
It should be noted that the broadcast process and V2V
communications process have different time periods, as
shown in Fig. 1, we mainly focus on resource allocation
and interference management in V2V communications process. We assume that the inter-vehicle distance of different
platoons is same, which is denoted by d0.

matrix, and the element of it, i.e., xi j,n, is given by

C. Problem Formulation
To maximize the spectral efficiency of all platoons with
the joint optimization of user clustering and resource allocation, we formulate the optimization problem as

In problem (6), the optimization variables are clustering
matrix XM×K×N and transmission power allocation matrix
PM×K. The total number of RBs used by all PVs is
M(K−2). Constraint (6b) indicates that the SINR of M-PVs
is no less than the minimum SINR requirement. Constraint
(6c) indicates that the transmission power of PVs should not
be larger than the maximum power. Constraint (6d) requires
that each M-PV can only be grouped into a cluster.
The optimization problem (6) is a maximum weighted
matching problem with nonlinear constraints, which is NPhard [13]. When there exist many PVs, exhaustive search
becomes unacceptable with high computational complexity.
Therefore, we propose a Hypergraph-based Resource Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) scheme to
solve the spectral efficiency maximization problem.
III. Hypergraph Based Resource Allocation
In this section, we will first give some preliminaries
about hypergraph theory and coloring algorithm, and then
construct a hypergraph for M-PVs. Finally, we introduce the
HRAIM scheme in detail.
A. Hypergraph Preliminaries
Here, we introduce several necessary definitions of hypergraph in the following [10].
Definition 1: A hypergraph H(X, E) is a vertex set X and
a set of edges E including hyperedges containing more than
two vertices and ordinary edges connecting two vertices.
Definition 2: In a hypergraph H(X, E), a strong deletion
of a vertex x ∈ X from H is to delete x from H and all the
edges containing x from E.
Definition 3: The monodegree of a vertex x is the maximum cardinality of a hyperedge subfamily E1(x) ⊆ E such
that two elements ei, ej ∈ E1(x), ei ∩ ej = x.
In Fig. 2, M-PVs constitute the vertex set, the interference
relationship among M-PVs constitutes ordinary edges set
and hyperedges set. Meanwhile, the set formed by edge 2
and edge 5 is the hyperedge subfamily of vertex x, and the
monodegree of x is 4.

edge 4 are ordinary edges. Edge 5 and edge 6 are hyperedges.
B. Interference Hypergraph Construction
We model M-PVs and the interference relationship among
several M-PVs as vertices and hyperedges, respectively. The
vertices in the same hyperedges represent that the cumulative
interference is so large that they cannot be grouped into
the same cluster. In other words, they cannot be colored
with the same color. As shown as Fig. 2, the M-PVs with
different circles represent that the M-PVs are in different
clusters. In the following, we establish the hypergraph with
the construction of ordinary edges and hyperedges.</li>
<li>Ordinary edges construction: For each vertex vji−1
reusing the same RB with another vehicle vls−1, if the SINR
of this vertex satisfies (7), then we connect two vertices with
an ordinary edge. As shown in Fig. 2, edge 1, edge 2, edge
3, and edge 4 are ordinary edges.

<li>Hyperedges construction: For each vertex vji−1
reusing the same RB with multiple vehicles, if the SINR
of this vertex satisfies (8), then we construct a hyperedge for
these vertices. As shown in Fig. 2, edge 5 and edge 6 are
hyperedges.

C. The Hypergraph-based Resource Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) Scheme for Multi-platoon
After constructing the hypergraph, we use hypergraph coloring algorithm to address the resource allocation problem.
In the coloring algorithm, the vertices in the same edge
should be colored by at least 2 colors. First, according
to the interference relationship among PVs, we establish
ordinary edges and hyperedges with (7) and (8) to construct a

hypergraph. Then, according to the constructed hypergraph,
we calculate the monodegree for each vertex, and label the
PV which has the minimum monodegree with fL, where L
is the total number of vertices. Next, we strongly delete this
vertex and then get a new hypergraph. Based on this new
hypergraph, we repeat these steps until all vertices are sorted
by their monodegree. Finally, we color these vertices according to F= {f1, f2&hellip;fL} in a color which is in the available
color set. Note that the available color set of a vertex contains
these colors not being used by all vertices in the same
edge. If the available color set is empty, this vertex remains
uncolored. We conclude the HRAIM scheme in Algorithm</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>In Algorithm 1, the computational complexity of step
1 and step 2 are O((MK)2) and O((MK)3), respectively.
From step 4 to step 9, we have a loop with MK iterations.
Since the computational complexity is O((MK)3) from step
4 to step 6, the total complexity from step 4 to step 9 is
O((MK)4). In summary, the computational complexity of
the proposed HRAIM scheme is O((MK)4).
Algorithm 1: Hypergraph-based Resource Allocation and Interference Management Scheme for Multiplatoon
Input:
γmin: the SINR threshold for M-PVs;
L: the number of M-PVs.
Output: the clustering results XM×K×N.

2: Construct hyperedges for each M-PV vji based on (8).
3: Set k = L;
Repeat:
4: for vi
j ∈ Vi, 1 ≤ i ≤ M do
5: Calculate monodegree for vji based on the hypergraph;
6: end for
7: Find the vertex with minimum monodegree and label it
by fk;
8: Strongly delete the vertex and form a new hypergraph;
9: Set k = k − 1;
Until: All vertices are sorted by monodegrees.
10: According to the user order of label set F= {f1, f2&hellip;fL},
color the vertices in a color selected from the available
color set.
After using Algorithm 1, we can obtain the clustering
results for M-PVs, i.e., the M-PVs with the same color is
a cluster. Referring to [14], we can prove that in problem
(6), the optimization objective function can be decomposed
into the sum of a convex function and a concave function.
Then we use the Interior Point Method to transform the
inequality constrained convex optimization problem into an
unconstrained problem. Finally, for each cluster, we use the
Concave-Convex Procedure to linearize the concave part so
that the non-convex problem can be solved as a convex
problem. Then we use Newton’s Method to optimize the
transmit powers in problem (6).

proposed HRAIM scheme in terms of sum data rate of
all M-PVs and spectral efficiency. In the simulations, we
assume that the number of PVs in each cluster is 3, and the
distance between platoons is 30 m. Besides, we set the SINR
threshold γmin = 4 dB, the pathloss exponent α = 3, and
the AWGN power σ2 = −30 dBm.
Fig. 3 illustrates the effects of the number of platoons
and the value of individual maximum transmission power
on sum data rate of all M-PVs. Generally, when the number
of platoons increases, the sum data rate of all M-PVs grows.
The reason is that as the number of platoons grows, although
M-PVs need to share RBs with other M-PVs, the M-PVs can
use more RBs at the same time, and thus M-PVs can still
achieve a higher sum data rate. Meanwhile, Fig. 4 presents
that with different value of individual maximum transmission
power, the changes of spectral efficiency of all M-PVs as the
platoons number increases. We can observe that when the
number of platoons increases, the spectral efficiency rises.
This reason is that when we have more platoons, the increase
in the sum data rate of all M-PVs is greater than the increase
in the number of RBs, which contributes to the growth of

spectral efficiency. Specifically, when the number of platoons
is small, the spectral efficiency and the sum data rate of
all M-PVs are the same for HRAIM scheme and traditional
graph-coloring algorithm. This phenomenon is because that
M-PVs have fewer candidate RBs reusing pairs when there
are fewer platoons.
Fig. 5 displays the effects of the inter-vehicle distance and
the value of individual maximum transmission power on sum
data rate of all M-PVs. Generally, given a fixed number of
M-PVs (i.e., RBs), when the inter-vehicle distance increases,
the sum data rate decreases since the inter-vehicle distance
reduces the desired signal power gains. From Fig. 6, we
can observe that the spectral efficiency decreases with the
growth of inter-vehicle distance, since the reduced sum data
rate results in a lower spectral efficiency when the number
of RBs is fixed. Besides, when the inter-vehicle distance
increases, the spectral efficiency and the sum data rate of all
M-PVs are nearly the same for both HRAIM scheme and
traditional graph-coloring algorithm, since the advantage of
cumulative interference management becomes smaller when
the interference influence among M-PVs gets less.
V. Conclusions
This paper studied the joint optimization problem of
spectrum sharing and interference management in multiplatoon scenario. We assumed that L-PVs used the dedicated
RBs when transmitting messages to BS and broadcasting
their CAMs to their M-PVs, respectively. Meanwhile, MPVs reused the RBs with each other to forward their CAMs
to the adjacent M-PVs behind them. To maximize the
spectral efficiency, we transformed the resource allocation
problem into a hypergraph coloring problem. We proposed
a HRAIM scheme to select M-PVs based on their predefined
minimum SINR thresholds. Numerical results illustrated the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of spectral
efficiency and sum data rate.

Abstract—Platoon communications in vehicular networks is
considered to have broad application prospects in improving
road capacity and traffic safety. This paper considers a multiplatoon vehicle scenario, in which platoon vehicles (PVs)
transmit cooperative awareness messages (CAMs) to other PVs
in the same platoon. The leader platoon vehicles (L-PVs)
use dedicated resource blocks (RBs) to communicate with the
base station (BS) and broadcast their CAMs to their member
platoon vehicles (M-PVs). Meanwhile, to increase spectral efficiency and satisfy the communication demands of PVs, we allow
M-PVs to reuse RBs with each other to transmit their CAMs.
Finally, due to the fact that traditional graph can only model
pairwise relations, we utilize hypergraph to model relationship
among several users and propose a Hypergraph-based Resource
Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) scheme
for multi-platoon scenario. Simulation results illustrate that
the proposed scheme shows a better performance in terms of
spectral efficiency and sum data rate when compared with
traditional graph coloring algorithm and random selection
scheme.

I. Introduction
In vehicle-to-everything communications, platoon is considered to be one of the most representative fifth-generation
(5G) use cases, which can enhance traffic efficiency [1].
To support the synchronous control of the platoon, all
platoon vehicles (PVs) should maintain the same speed and
a constant inter-vehicle distance to ensure string stability [2]
[3], which makes the spacing and velocity error of platoon
would not be amplified with the downstream of the platoon. Therefore, it is essential to transmit their cooperative
awareness messages (CAMs) to other PVs. CAMs include
messages about the driving strategy of the platoon such
as speed and acceleration, as well as information about
resource scheduling within the platoon [1]. According to

communication structure of PVs, there are three main control
strategies, i.e., predecessor following control (PFC) strategy,
symmetric bidirectional control (SBC) strategy, predecessorleader following control (PLFC) strategy [4] [5]. Among
them, the PLFC strategy is a major approach, which shows
outstanding performance in improving string stability [5].
Specifically, each member platoon vehicle (M-PV) communicates with the leader platoon vehicle (L-PV) and the
adjacent PV in front of it to ensure string stability.
When PVs transmit their CAMs, they need to occupy
a certain amount of spectrum resources to realize predefined communication quality, e.g., the minimum data rate
requirements. In face of limited spectrum resources, reusing
spectrum is a promising way to enhance spectral efficiency,
which however introduces more interference among vehicles.
In this case, allocating spectrum resources reasonably is critical to improve communication delay and network capacity.
The authors in [6] jointly considered the platoon size and
power consumption of the platoon, and designed a twostep resource allocation strategy based on branch and bound
algorithm. Works in [7] proposed a time division-based
intra-platoon and minimum rate guaranteed inter-platoon
resource allocation mechanisms to allocate resources for
D2D users efficiently within the platoon. However, the joint
optimization problem of resource allocation and interference
management for multi-platoon scenario has not been well
studied.
The traditional graph can tackle the interference problem,
and the ordinary edges can model pairwise relations, which
however is not sufficient in modeling cumulative interference
in wireless networks. Hypergraph is a useful tool to tackle
this challenge, and it has been applied widely in recent
years [8] [9], since the hyperedges in hypergraph can take
into account the cumulative interference from several users.
Specifically, hypergraph coloring algorithm is an approximate and efficient method for resource allocation problem,
in which users can be modeled as vertices, and the interference relationship among multi-users can be constructed
as hyperedges, RBs can be constructed as different colors
[8] [10]. The authors in [11] used a weighted three-partite
interference hypergraph (IHG) to imitate the complex interference and put forward an IHG-based three-dimensional
matching resource allocation protocol. Meanwhile, works
in [12] proposed a hypergraph spectral clustering based

method in non-orthogonal multiple access heterogeneous
network to deal with the serious cumulative interference.
However, at the time of writing, there is no work invoking
the hypergraph coloring algorithm to address the resource
allocation problem in multi-platoon scenario.
Motivated by above discussions, this paper focuses on
resource allocation and interference management in multiplatoon scenario based on hypergraph coloring algorithm.
Main contributions are summarized as follows. Firstly, we
consider a multi-platoon scenario and formulate an optimization problem to maximize the spectral efficiency of
all M-PVs in the scenario. Then we propose a resource
allocation and interference management scheme for multiplatoon based on hypergraph coloring algorithm to solve the
problem. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the
proposed scheme in terms of spectral efficiency and sum
date rate.
II. System Model And Problem Formulation
In this section, we first describe the multi-platoon scenario along with the channel model. Then, we formulate a
general resource allocation problem to maximize the spectral
efficiency for the whole network.
A. System Model
We consider a multi-platoon scenario consisting of M
platoons on a fixed road segment, as shown in Fig. 1. The
i-th platoon is denoted by Vi. The number of PVs in each
platoon is the same, which is denoted by K, and the PVs
in Vi are denoted by Vi = {v1i, v2i, &hellip;, vji, &hellip;, vKi i}. Among
them, v1i is the L-PV and vji is the j-th PV of platoon Vi.
The licensed spectrum is divided into multiple RBs with
unit bandwidth, which can be reused by M-PVs. The MPVs reusing the same RBs are grouped into a cluster, and
the clusters are denoted by R= {r1, r2, &hellip;, rN}. Without
loss of generality, we apply the PLFC strategy in this work,
and give detailed discussions on its two main transmission
processes.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Broadcast process: Firstly, the L-PVs not only need
to receive the information from the BS, such as resource
scheduling messages, but also need to transmit their CAMs
to BS. The corresponding communication links are denoted
with red and orange dotted arrows in Fig. 1. Then L-PVs
broadcast their CAMs to their M-PVs. Due to the broadcast
range is limited, the L-PVs might not be able to cover the
entire platoon in the broadcast process.</li>
<li>V2V communications process: Once the process of the
broadcast is completed, each M-PV will start transmitting its
own CAMs to the adjacent M-PV behind it, the corresponding communication links are denoted with the blue arrow
in Fig. 1. We apply Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD)
mechanism so that M-PVs can transmit and receive CAMs
using different RBs simultaneously. Meanwhile, different
M-PVs can share RBs within controllable interference. By
assuming that each M-PV occupies a dedicated RB, they can
reuse the RBs of all members when they are grouped into
one cluster. For example, three M-PVs in the same cluster
can reuse three RBs simultaneously.
B. Channel Models
It should be noted that the broadcast process and V2V
communications process have different time periods, as
shown in Fig. 1, we mainly focus on resource allocation
and interference management in V2V communications process. We assume that the inter-vehicle distance of different
platoons is same, which is denoted by d0.

To maximize the spectral efficiency of all platoons with
the joint optimization of user clustering and resource allocation, we formulate the optimization problem as

In problem (6), the optimization variables are clustering
matrix XM×K×N and transmission power allocation matrix
PM×K. The total number of RBs used by all PVs is
M(K−2). Constraint (6b) indicates that the SINR of M-PVs
is no less than the minimum SINR requirement. Constraint
(6c) indicates that the transmission power of PVs should not
be larger than the maximum power. Constraint (6d) requires
that each M-PV can only be grouped into a cluster.
The optimization problem (6) is a maximum weighted
matching problem with nonlinear constraints, which is NPhard [13]. When there exist many PVs, exhaustive search
becomes unacceptable with high computational complexity.
Therefore, we propose a Hypergraph-based Resource Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) scheme to
solve the spectral efficiency maximization problem.
III. Hypergraph Based Resource Allocation
In this section, we will first give some preliminaries
about hypergraph theory and coloring algorithm, and then
construct a hypergraph for M-PVs. Finally, we introduce the
HRAIM scheme in detail.
A. Hypergraph Preliminaries
Here, we introduce several necessary definitions of hypergraph in the following [10].
Definition 1: A hypergraph H(X, E) is a vertex set X and
a set of edges E including hyperedges containing more than
two vertices and ordinary edges connecting two vertices.
Definition 2: In a hypergraph H(X, E), a strong deletion
of a vertex x ∈ X from H is to delete x from H and all the
edges containing x from E.
Definition 3: The monodegree of a vertex x is the maximum cardinality of a hyperedge subfamily E1(x) ⊆ E such
that two elements ei, ej ∈ E1(x), ei ∩ ej = x.
In Fig. 2, M-PVs constitute the vertex set, the interference
relationship among M-PVs constitutes ordinary edges set
and hyperedges set. Meanwhile, the set formed by edge 2
and edge 5 is the hyperedge subfamily of vertex x, and the
monodegree of x is 4.

edge 4 are ordinary edges. Edge 5 and edge 6 are hyperedges.
B. Interference Hypergraph Construction
We model M-PVs and the interference relationship among
several M-PVs as vertices and hyperedges, respectively. The
vertices in the same hyperedges represent that the cumulative
interference is so large that they cannot be grouped into
the same cluster. In other words, they cannot be colored
with the same color. As shown as Fig. 2, the M-PVs with
different circles represent that the M-PVs are in different
clusters. In the following, we establish the hypergraph with
the construction of ordinary edges and hyperedges.</li>
<li>Ordinary edges construction: For each vertex vji−1
reusing the same RB with another vehicle vls−1, if the SINR
of this vertex satisfies (7), then we connect two vertices with
an ordinary edge. As shown in Fig. 2, edge 1, edge 2, edge
3, and edge 4 are ordinary edges.

<li>Hyperedges construction: For each vertex vji−1
reusing the same RB with multiple vehicles, if the SINR
of this vertex satisfies (8), then we construct a hyperedge for
these vertices. As shown in Fig. 2, edge 5 and edge 6 are
hyperedges.

C. The Hypergraph-based Resource Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) Scheme for Multi-platoon
After constructing the hypergraph, we use hypergraph coloring algorithm to address the resource allocation problem.
In the coloring algorithm, the vertices in the same edge
should be colored by at least 2 colors. First, according
to the interference relationship among PVs, we establish
ordinary edges and hyperedges with (7) and (8) to construct a

hypergraph. Then, according to the constructed hypergraph,
we calculate the monodegree for each vertex, and label the
PV which has the minimum monodegree with fL, where L
is the total number of vertices. Next, we strongly delete this
vertex and then get a new hypergraph. Based on this new
hypergraph, we repeat these steps until all vertices are sorted
by their monodegree. Finally, we color these vertices according to F= {f1, f2&hellip;fL} in a color which is in the available
color set. Note that the available color set of a vertex contains
these colors not being used by all vertices in the same
edge. If the available color set is empty, this vertex remains
uncolored. We conclude the HRAIM scheme in Algorithm</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>In Algorithm 1, the computational complexity of step
1 and step 2 are O((MK)2) and O((MK)3), respectively.
From step 4 to step 9, we have a loop with MK iterations.
Since the computational complexity is O((MK)3) from step
4 to step 6, the total complexity from step 4 to step 9 is
O((MK)4). In summary, the computational complexity of
the proposed HRAIM scheme is O((MK)4).

8: Strongly delete the vertex and form a new hypergraph;
9: Set k = k − 1;
Until: All vertices are sorted by monodegrees.
10: According to the user order of label set F= {f1, f2&hellip;fL},
color the vertices in a color selected from the available
color set.
After using Algorithm 1, we can obtain the clustering
results for M-PVs, i.e., the M-PVs with the same color is
a cluster. Referring to [14], we can prove that in problem
(6), the optimization objective function can be decomposed
into the sum of a convex function and a concave function.
Then we use the Interior Point Method to transform the
inequality constrained convex optimization problem into an
unconstrained problem. Finally, for each cluster, we use the
Concave-Convex Procedure to linearize the concave part so
that the non-convex problem can be solved as a convex
problem. Then we use Newton’s Method to optimize the
transmit powers in problem (6).

proposed HRAIM scheme in terms of sum data rate of
all M-PVs and spectral efficiency. In the simulations, we
assume that the number of PVs in each cluster is 3, and the
distance between platoons is 30 m. Besides, we set the SINR
threshold γmin = 4 dB, the pathloss exponent α = 3, and
the AWGN power σ2 = −30 dBm.
Fig. 3 illustrates the effects of the number of platoons
and the value of individual maximum transmission power
on sum data rate of all M-PVs. Generally, when the number
of platoons increases, the sum data rate of all M-PVs grows.
The reason is that as the number of platoons grows, although
M-PVs need to share RBs with other M-PVs, the M-PVs can
use more RBs at the same time, and thus M-PVs can still
achieve a higher sum data rate. Meanwhile, Fig. 4 presents
that with different value of individual maximum transmission
power, the changes of spectral efficiency of all M-PVs as the
platoons number increases. We can observe that when the
number of platoons increases, the spectral efficiency rises.
This reason is that when we have more platoons, the increase
in the sum data rate of all M-PVs is greater than the increase
in the number of RBs, which contributes to the growth of

spectral efficiency. Specifically, when the number of platoons
is small, the spectral efficiency and the sum data rate of
all M-PVs are the same for HRAIM scheme and traditional
graph-coloring algorithm. This phenomenon is because that
M-PVs have fewer candidate RBs reusing pairs when there
are fewer platoons.
Fig. 5 displays the effects of the inter-vehicle distance and
the value of individual maximum transmission power on sum
data rate of all M-PVs. Generally, given a fixed number of
M-PVs (i.e., RBs), when the inter-vehicle distance increases,
the sum data rate decreases since the inter-vehicle distance
reduces the desired signal power gains. From Fig. 6, we
can observe that the spectral efficiency decreases with the
growth of inter-vehicle distance, since the reduced sum data
rate results in a lower spectral efficiency when the number
of RBs is fixed. Besides, when the inter-vehicle distance
increases, the spectral efficiency and the sum data rate of all
M-PVs are nearly the same for both HRAIM scheme and
traditional graph-coloring algorithm, since the advantage of
cumulative interference management becomes smaller when
the interference influence among M-PVs gets less.
V. Conclusions
This paper studied the joint optimization problem of
spectrum sharing and interference management in multiplatoon scenario. We assumed that L-PVs used the dedicated
RBs when transmitting messages to BS and broadcasting
their CAMs to their M-PVs, respectively. Meanwhile, MPVs reused the RBs with each other to forward their CAMs
to the adjacent M-PVs behind them. To maximize the
spectral efficiency, we transformed the resource allocation
problem into a hypergraph coloring problem. We proposed
a HRAIM scheme to select M-PVs based on their predefined
minimum SINR thresholds. Numerical results illustrated the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of spectral
efficiency and sum data rate.

Abstract—Platoon communications in vehicular networks is
considered to have broad application prospects in improving
road capacity and traffic safety. This paper considers a multiplatoon vehicle scenario, in which platoon vehicles (PVs)
transmit cooperative awareness messages (CAMs) to other PVs
in the same platoon. The leader platoon vehicles (L-PVs)
use dedicated resource blocks (RBs) to communicate with the
base station (BS) and broadcast their CAMs to their member
platoon vehicles (M-PVs). Meanwhile, to increase spectral efficiency and satisfy the communication demands of PVs, we allow
M-PVs to reuse RBs with each other to transmit their CAMs.
Finally, due to the fact that traditional graph can only model
pairwise relations, we utilize hypergraph to model relationship
among several users and propose a Hypergraph-based Resource
Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) scheme
for multi-platoon scenario. Simulation results illustrate that
the proposed scheme shows a better performance in terms of
spectral efficiency and sum data rate when compared with
traditional graph coloring algorithm and random selection
scheme.

I. Introduction
In vehicle-to-everything communications, platoon is considered to be one of the most representative fifth-generation
(5G) use cases, which can enhance traffic efficiency [1].
To support the synchronous control of the platoon, all
platoon vehicles (PVs) should maintain the same speed and
a constant inter-vehicle distance to ensure string stability [2]
[3], which makes the spacing and velocity error of platoon
would not be amplified with the downstream of the platoon. Therefore, it is essential to transmit their cooperative
awareness messages (CAMs) to other PVs. CAMs include
messages about the driving strategy of the platoon such
as speed and acceleration, as well as information about
resource scheduling within the platoon [1]. According to

communication structure of PVs, there are three main control
strategies, i.e., predecessor following control (PFC) strategy,
symmetric bidirectional control (SBC) strategy, predecessorleader following control (PLFC) strategy [4] [5]. Among
them, the PLFC strategy is a major approach, which shows
outstanding performance in improving string stability [5].
Specifically, each member platoon vehicle (M-PV) communicates with the leader platoon vehicle (L-PV) and the
adjacent PV in front of it to ensure string stability.
When PVs transmit their CAMs, they need to occupy
a certain amount of spectrum resources to realize predefined communication quality, e.g., the minimum data rate
requirements. In face of limited spectrum resources, reusing
spectrum is a promising way to enhance spectral efficiency,
which however introduces more interference among vehicles.
In this case, allocating spectrum resources reasonably is critical to improve communication delay and network capacity.
The authors in [6] jointly considered the platoon size and
power consumption of the platoon, and designed a twostep resource allocation strategy based on branch and bound
algorithm. Works in [7] proposed a time division-based
intra-platoon and minimum rate guaranteed inter-platoon
resource allocation mechanisms to allocate resources for
D2D users efficiently within the platoon. However, the joint
optimization problem of resource allocation and interference
management for multi-platoon scenario has not been well
studied.
The traditional graph can tackle the interference problem,
and the ordinary edges can model pairwise relations, which
however is not sufficient in modeling cumulative interference
in wireless networks. Hypergraph is a useful tool to tackle
this challenge, and it has been applied widely in recent
years [8] [9], since the hyperedges in hypergraph can take
into account the cumulative interference from several users.
Specifically, hypergraph coloring algorithm is an approximate and efficient method for resource allocation problem,
in which users can be modeled as vertices, and the interference relationship among multi-users can be constructed
as hyperedges, RBs can be constructed as different colors
[8] [10]. The authors in [11] used a weighted three-partite
interference hypergraph (IHG) to imitate the complex interference and put forward an IHG-based three-dimensional
matching resource allocation protocol. Meanwhile, works
in [12] proposed a hypergraph spectral clustering based

method in non-orthogonal multiple access heterogeneous
network to deal with the serious cumulative interference.
However, at the time of writing, there is no work invoking
the hypergraph coloring algorithm to address the resource
allocation problem in multi-platoon scenario.
Motivated by above discussions, this paper focuses on
resource allocation and interference management in multiplatoon scenario based on hypergraph coloring algorithm.
Main contributions are summarized as follows. Firstly, we
consider a multi-platoon scenario and formulate an optimization problem to maximize the spectral efficiency of
all M-PVs in the scenario. Then we propose a resource
allocation and interference management scheme for multiplatoon based on hypergraph coloring algorithm to solve the
problem. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the
proposed scheme in terms of spectral efficiency and sum
date rate.
II. System Model And Problem Formulation
In this section, we first describe the multi-platoon scenario along with the channel model. Then, we formulate a
general resource allocation problem to maximize the spectral
efficiency for the whole network.
A. System Model
We consider a multi-platoon scenario consisting of M
platoons on a fixed road segment, as shown in Fig. 1. The
i-th platoon is denoted by Vi. The number of PVs in each
platoon is the same, which is denoted by K, and the PVs
in Vi are denoted by Vi = {v1i, v2i, &hellip;, vji, &hellip;, vKi i}. Among
them, v1i is the L-PV and vji is the j-th PV of platoon Vi.
The licensed spectrum is divided into multiple RBs with
unit bandwidth, which can be reused by M-PVs. The MPVs reusing the same RBs are grouped into a cluster, and
the clusters are denoted by R= {r1, r2, &hellip;, rN}. Without
loss of generality, we apply the PLFC strategy in this work,
and give detailed discussions on its two main transmission
processes.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Broadcast process: Firstly, the L-PVs not only need
to receive the information from the BS, such as resource
scheduling messages, but also need to transmit their CAMs
to BS. The corresponding communication links are denoted
with red and orange dotted arrows in Fig. 1. Then L-PVs
broadcast their CAMs to their M-PVs. Due to the broadcast
range is limited, the L-PVs might not be able to cover the
entire platoon in the broadcast process.</li>
<li>V2V communications process: Once the process of the
broadcast is completed, each M-PV will start transmitting its
own CAMs to the adjacent M-PV behind it, the corresponding communication links are denoted with the blue arrow
in Fig. 1. We apply Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD)
mechanism so that M-PVs can transmit and receive CAMs
using different RBs simultaneously. Meanwhile, different
M-PVs can share RBs within controllable interference. By
assuming that each M-PV occupies a dedicated RB, they can
reuse the RBs of all members when they are grouped into
one cluster. For example, three M-PVs in the same cluster
can reuse three RBs simultaneously.
B. Channel Models
It should be noted that the broadcast process and V2V
communications process have different time periods, as
shown in Fig. 1, we mainly focus on resource allocation
and interference management in V2V communications process. We assume that the inter-vehicle distance of different
platoons is same, which is denoted by d0.

To maximize the spectral efficiency of all platoons with
the joint optimization of user clustering and resource allocation, we formulate the optimization problem as

In problem (6), the optimization variables are clustering
matrix XM×K×N and transmission power allocation matrix
PM×K. The total number of RBs used by all PVs is
M(K−2). Constraint (6b) indicates that the SINR of M-PVs
is no less than the minimum SINR requirement. Constraint
(6c) indicates that the transmission power of PVs should not
be larger than the maximum power. Constraint (6d) requires
that each M-PV can only be grouped into a cluster.
The optimization problem (6) is a maximum weighted
matching problem with nonlinear constraints, which is NPhard [13]. When there exist many PVs, exhaustive search
becomes unacceptable with high computational complexity.
Therefore, we propose a Hypergraph-based Resource Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) scheme to
solve the spectral efficiency maximization problem.
III. Hypergraph Based Resource Allocation
In this section, we will first give some preliminaries
about hypergraph theory and coloring algorithm, and then
construct a hypergraph for M-PVs. Finally, we introduce the
HRAIM scheme in detail.
A. Hypergraph Preliminaries
Here, we introduce several necessary definitions of hypergraph in the following [10].
Definition 1: A hypergraph H(X, E) is a vertex set X and
a set of edges E including hyperedges containing more than
two vertices and ordinary edges connecting two vertices.
Definition 2: In a hypergraph H(X, E), a strong deletion
of a vertex x ∈ X from H is to delete x from H and all the
edges containing x from E.
Definition 3: The monodegree of a vertex x is the maximum cardinality of a hyperedge subfamily E1(x) ⊆ E such
that two elements ei, ej ∈ E1(x), ei ∩ ej = x.
In Fig. 2, M-PVs constitute the vertex set, the interference
relationship among M-PVs constitutes ordinary edges set
and hyperedges set. Meanwhile, the set formed by edge 2
and edge 5 is the hyperedge subfamily of vertex x, and the
monodegree of x is 4.

edge 4 are ordinary edges. Edge 5 and edge 6 are hyperedges.
B. Interference Hypergraph Construction
We model M-PVs and the interference relationship among
several M-PVs as vertices and hyperedges, respectively. The
vertices in the same hyperedges represent that the cumulative
interference is so large that they cannot be grouped into
the same cluster. In other words, they cannot be colored
with the same color. As shown as Fig. 2, the M-PVs with
different circles represent that the M-PVs are in different
clusters. In the following, we establish the hypergraph with
the construction of ordinary edges and hyperedges.</li>
<li>Ordinary edges construction: For each vertex vji−1
reusing the same RB with another vehicle vls−1, if the SINR
of this vertex satisfies (7), then we connect two vertices with
an ordinary edge. As shown in Fig. 2, edge 1, edge 2, edge
3, and edge 4 are ordinary edges.

<li>Hyperedges construction: For each vertex vji−1
reusing the same RB with multiple vehicles, if the SINR
of this vertex satisfies (8), then we construct a hyperedge for
these vertices. As shown in Fig. 2, edge 5 and edge 6 are
hyperedges.

C. The Hypergraph-based Resource Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) Scheme for Multi-platoon
After constructing the hypergraph, we use hypergraph coloring algorithm to address the resource allocation problem.
In the coloring algorithm, the vertices in the same edge
should be colored by at least 2 colors. First, according
to the interference relationship among PVs, we establish
ordinary edges and hyperedges with (7) and (8) to construct a

hypergraph. Then, according to the constructed hypergraph,
we calculate the monodegree for each vertex, and label the
PV which has the minimum monodegree with fL, where L
is the total number of vertices. Next, we strongly delete this
vertex and then get a new hypergraph. Based on this new
hypergraph, we repeat these steps until all vertices are sorted
by their monodegree. Finally, we color these vertices according to F= {f1, f2&hellip;fL} in a color which is in the available
color set. Note that the available color set of a vertex contains
these colors not being used by all vertices in the same
edge. If the available color set is empty, this vertex remains
uncolored. We conclude the HRAIM scheme in Algorithm</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>In Algorithm 1, the computational complexity of step
1 and step 2 are O((MK)2) and O((MK)3), respectively.
From step 4 to step 9, we have a loop with MK iterations.
Since the computational complexity is O((MK)3) from step
4 to step 6, the total complexity from step 4 to step 9 is

the proposed HRAIM scheme is O((MK)4).

After using Algorithm 1, we can obtain the clustering
results for M-PVs, i.e., the M-PVs with the same color is
a cluster. Referring to [14], we can prove that in problem
(6), the optimization objective function can be decomposed
into the sum of a convex function and a concave function.
Then we use the Interior Point Method to transform the
inequality constrained convex optimization problem into an
unconstrained problem. Finally, for each cluster, we use the
Concave-Convex Procedure to linearize the concave part so
that the non-convex problem can be solved as a convex
problem. Then we use Newton’s Method to optimize the
transmit powers in problem (6).

proposed HRAIM scheme in terms of sum data rate of
all M-PVs and spectral efficiency. In the simulations, we
assume that the number of PVs in each cluster is 3, and the
distance between platoons is 30 m. Besides, we set the SINR
threshold γmin = 4 dB, the pathloss exponent α = 3, and
the AWGN power σ2 = −30 dBm.
Fig. 3 illustrates the effects of the number of platoons
and the value of individual maximum transmission power
on sum data rate of all M-PVs. Generally, when the number
of platoons increases, the sum data rate of all M-PVs grows.
The reason is that as the number of platoons grows, although
M-PVs need to share RBs with other M-PVs, the M-PVs can
use more RBs at the same time, and thus M-PVs can still
achieve a higher sum data rate. Meanwhile, Fig. 4 presents
that with different value of individual maximum transmission
power, the changes of spectral efficiency of all M-PVs as the
platoons number increases. We can observe that when the
number of platoons increases, the spectral efficiency rises.
This reason is that when we have more platoons, the increase
in the sum data rate of all M-PVs is greater than the increase
in the number of RBs, which contributes to the growth of

spectral efficiency. Specifically, when the number of platoons
is small, the spectral efficiency and the sum data rate of
all M-PVs are the same for HRAIM scheme and traditional
graph-coloring algorithm. This phenomenon is because that
M-PVs have fewer candidate RBs reusing pairs when there
are fewer platoons.
Fig. 5 displays the effects of the inter-vehicle distance and
the value of individual maximum transmission power on sum
data rate of all M-PVs. Generally, given a fixed number of
M-PVs (i.e., RBs), when the inter-vehicle distance increases,
the sum data rate decreases since the inter-vehicle distance
reduces the desired signal power gains. From Fig. 6, we
can observe that the spectral efficiency decreases with the
growth of inter-vehicle distance, since the reduced sum data
rate results in a lower spectral efficiency when the number
of RBs is fixed. Besides, when the inter-vehicle distance
increases, the spectral efficiency and the sum data rate of all
M-PVs are nearly the same for both HRAIM scheme and
traditional graph-coloring algorithm, since the advantage of
cumulative interference management becomes smaller when
the interference influence among M-PVs gets less.
V. Conclusions
This paper studied the joint optimization problem of
spectrum sharing and interference management in multiplatoon scenario. We assumed that L-PVs used the dedicated
RBs when transmitting messages to BS and broadcasting
their CAMs to their M-PVs, respectively. Meanwhile, MPVs reused the RBs with each other to forward their CAMs
to the adjacent M-PVs behind them. To maximize the
spectral efficiency, we transformed the resource allocation
problem into a hypergraph coloring problem. We proposed
a HRAIM scheme to select M-PVs based on their predefined
minimum SINR thresholds. Numerical results illustrated the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of spectral
efficiency and sum data rate.

Abstract—Platoon communications in vehicular networks is
considered to have broad application prospects in improving
road capacity and traffic safety. This paper considers a multiplatoon vehicle scenario, in which platoon vehicles (PVs)
transmit cooperative awareness messages (CAMs) to other PVs
in the same platoon. The leader platoon vehicles (L-PVs)
use dedicated resource blocks (RBs) to communicate with the
base station (BS) and broadcast their CAMs to their member
platoon vehicles (M-PVs). Meanwhile, to increase spectral efficiency and satisfy the communication demands of PVs, we allow
M-PVs to reuse RBs with each other to transmit their CAMs.
Finally, due to the fact that traditional graph can only model
pairwise relations, we utilize hypergraph to model relationship
among several users and propose a Hypergraph-based Resource
Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) scheme
for multi-platoon scenario. Simulation results illustrate that
the proposed scheme shows a better performance in terms of
spectral efficiency and sum data rate when compared with
traditional graph coloring algorithm and random selection
scheme.

I. Introduction
In vehicle-to-everything communications, platoon is considered to be one of the most representative fifth-generation
(5G) use cases, which can enhance traffic efficiency [1].
To support the synchronous control of the platoon, all
platoon vehicles (PVs) should maintain the same speed and
a constant inter-vehicle distance to ensure string stability [2]
[3], which makes the spacing and velocity error of platoon
would not be amplified with the downstream of the platoon. Therefore, it is essential to transmit their cooperative
awareness messages (CAMs) to other PVs. CAMs include
messages about the driving strategy of the platoon such
as speed and acceleration, as well as information about
resource scheduling within the platoon [1]. According to

communication structure of PVs, there are three main control
strategies, i.e., predecessor following control (PFC) strategy,
symmetric bidirectional control (SBC) strategy, predecessorleader following control (PLFC) strategy [4] [5]. Among
them, the PLFC strategy is a major approach, which shows
outstanding performance in improving string stability [5].
Specifically, each member platoon vehicle (M-PV) communicates with the leader platoon vehicle (L-PV) and the
adjacent PV in front of it to ensure string stability.
When PVs transmit their CAMs, they need to occupy
a certain amount of spectrum resources to realize predefined communication quality, e.g., the minimum data rate
requirements. In face of limited spectrum resources, reusing
spectrum is a promising way to enhance spectral efficiency,
which however introduces more interference among vehicles.
In this case, allocating spectrum resources reasonably is critical to improve communication delay and network capacity.
The authors in [6] jointly considered the platoon size and
power consumption of the platoon, and designed a twostep resource allocation strategy based on branch and bound
algorithm. Works in [7] proposed a time division-based
intra-platoon and minimum rate guaranteed inter-platoon
resource allocation mechanisms to allocate resources for
D2D users efficiently within the platoon. However, the joint
optimization problem of resource allocation and interference
management for multi-platoon scenario has not been well
studied.
The traditional graph can tackle the interference problem,
and the ordinary edges can model pairwise relations, which
however is not sufficient in modeling cumulative interference
in wireless networks. Hypergraph is a useful tool to tackle
this challenge, and it has been applied widely in recent
years [8] [9], since the hyperedges in hypergraph can take
into account the cumulative interference from several users.
Specifically, hypergraph coloring algorithm is an approximate and efficient method for resource allocation problem,
in which users can be modeled as vertices, and the interference relationship among multi-users can be constructed
as hyperedges, RBs can be constructed as different colors
[8] [10]. The authors in [11] used a weighted three-partite
interference hypergraph (IHG) to imitate the complex interference and put forward an IHG-based three-dimensional
matching resource allocation protocol. Meanwhile, works
in [12] proposed a hypergraph spectral clustering based

method in non-orthogonal multiple access heterogeneous
network to deal with the serious cumulative interference.
However, at the time of writing, there is no work invoking
the hypergraph coloring algorithm to address the resource
allocation problem in multi-platoon scenario.
Motivated by above discussions, this paper focuses on
resource allocation and interference management in multiplatoon scenario based on hypergraph coloring algorithm.
Main contributions are summarized as follows. Firstly, we
consider a multi-platoon scenario and formulate an optimization problem to maximize the spectral efficiency of
all M-PVs in the scenario. Then we propose a resource
allocation and interference management scheme for multiplatoon based on hypergraph coloring algorithm to solve the
problem. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the
proposed scheme in terms of spectral efficiency and sum
date rate.
II. System Model And Problem Formulation
In this section, we first describe the multi-platoon scenario along with the channel model. Then, we formulate a
general resource allocation problem to maximize the spectral
efficiency for the whole network.
A. System Model
We consider a multi-platoon scenario consisting of M
platoons on a fixed road segment, as shown in Fig. 1. The
i-th platoon is denoted by Vi. The number of PVs in each
platoon is the same, which is denoted by K, and the PVs
in Vi are denoted by Vi = {v1i, v2i, &hellip;, vji, &hellip;, vKi i}. Among
them, v1i is the L-PV and vji is the j-th PV of platoon Vi.
The licensed spectrum is divided into multiple RBs with
unit bandwidth, which can be reused by M-PVs. The MPVs reusing the same RBs are grouped into a cluster, and
the clusters are denoted by R= {r1, r2, &hellip;, rN}. Without
loss of generality, we apply the PLFC strategy in this work,
and give detailed discussions on its two main transmission
processes.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Broadcast process: Firstly, the L-PVs not only need
to receive the information from the BS, such as resource
scheduling messages, but also need to transmit their CAMs
to BS. The corresponding communication links are denoted
with red and orange dotted arrows in Fig. 1. Then L-PVs
broadcast their CAMs to their M-PVs. Due to the broadcast
range is limited, the L-PVs might not be able to cover the
entire platoon in the broadcast process.</li>
<li>V2V communications process: Once the process of the
broadcast is completed, each M-PV will start transmitting its
own CAMs to the adjacent M-PV behind it, the corresponding communication links are denoted with the blue arrow
in Fig. 1. We apply Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD)
mechanism so that M-PVs can transmit and receive CAMs
using different RBs simultaneously. Meanwhile, different
M-PVs can share RBs within controllable interference. By
assuming that each M-PV occupies a dedicated RB, they can
reuse the RBs of all members when they are grouped into
one cluster. For example, three M-PVs in the same cluster
can reuse three RBs simultaneously.
B. Channel Models
It should be noted that the broadcast process and V2V
communications process have different time periods, as
shown in Fig. 1, we mainly focus on resource allocation
and interference management in V2V communications process. We assume that the inter-vehicle distance of different
platoons is same, which is denoted by d0.

To maximize the spectral efficiency of all platoons with
the joint optimization of user clustering and resource allocation, we formulate the optimization problem as

In problem (6), the optimization variables are clustering
matrix XM×K×N and transmission power allocation matrix
PM×K. The total number of RBs used by all PVs is
M(K−2). Constraint (6b) indicates that the SINR of M-PVs
is no less than the minimum SINR requirement. Constraint
(6c) indicates that the transmission power of PVs should not
be larger than the maximum power. Constraint (6d) requires
that each M-PV can only be grouped into a cluster.
The optimization problem (6) is a maximum weighted
matching problem with nonlinear constraints, which is NPhard [13]. When there exist many PVs, exhaustive search
becomes unacceptable with high computational complexity.
Therefore, we propose a Hypergraph-based Resource Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) scheme to
solve the spectral efficiency maximization problem.
III. Hypergraph Based Resource Allocation
In this section, we will first give some preliminaries
about hypergraph theory and coloring algorithm, and then
construct a hypergraph for M-PVs. Finally, we introduce the
HRAIM scheme in detail.
A. Hypergraph Preliminaries
Here, we introduce several necessary definitions of hypergraph in the following [10].
Definition 1: A hypergraph H(X, E) is a vertex set X and
a set of edges E including hyperedges containing more than
two vertices and ordinary edges connecting two vertices.
Definition 2: In a hypergraph H(X, E), a strong deletion
of a vertex x ∈ X from H is to delete x from H and all the
edges containing x from E.
Definition 3: The monodegree of a vertex x is the maximum cardinality of a hyperedge subfamily E1(x) ⊆ E such
that two elements ei, ej ∈ E1(x), ei ∩ ej = x.
In Fig. 2, M-PVs constitute the vertex set, the interference
relationship among M-PVs constitutes ordinary edges set
and hyperedges set. Meanwhile, the set formed by edge 2
and edge 5 is the hyperedge subfamily of vertex x, and the
monodegree of x is 4.

B. Interference Hypergraph Construction
We model M-PVs and the interference relationship among
several M-PVs as vertices and hyperedges, respectively. The
vertices in the same hyperedges represent that the cumulative
interference is so large that they cannot be grouped into
the same cluster. In other words, they cannot be colored
with the same color. As shown as Fig. 2, the M-PVs with
different circles represent that the M-PVs are in different
clusters. In the following, we establish the hypergraph with
the construction of ordinary edges and hyperedges.</li>
<li>Ordinary edges construction: For each vertex vji−1
reusing the same RB with another vehicle vls−1, if the SINR
of this vertex satisfies (7), then we connect two vertices with
an ordinary edge. As shown in Fig. 2, edge 1, edge 2, edge
3, and edge 4 are ordinary edges.

<li>Hyperedges construction: For each vertex vji−1
reusing the same RB with multiple vehicles, if the SINR
of this vertex satisfies (8), then we construct a hyperedge for
these vertices. As shown in Fig. 2, edge 5 and edge 6 are
hyperedges.

C. The Hypergraph-based Resource Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) Scheme for Multi-platoon
After constructing the hypergraph, we use hypergraph coloring algorithm to address the resource allocation problem.
In the coloring algorithm, the vertices in the same edge
should be colored by at least 2 colors. First, according
to the interference relationship among PVs, we establish
ordinary edges and hyperedges with (7) and (8) to construct a

hypergraph. Then, according to the constructed hypergraph,
we calculate the monodegree for each vertex, and label the
PV which has the minimum monodegree with fL, where L
is the total number of vertices. Next, we strongly delete this
vertex and then get a new hypergraph. Based on this new

by their monodegree. Finally, we color these vertices according to F= {f1, f2&hellip;fL} in a color which is in the available
color set. Note that the available color set of a vertex contains
these colors not being used by all vertices in the same
edge. If the available color set is empty, this vertex remains
uncolored. We conclude the HRAIM scheme in Algorithm</li>

From step 4 to step 9, we have a loop with MK iterations.
Since the computational complexity is O((MK)3) from step
4 to step 6, the total complexity from step 4 to step 9 is
O((MK)4). In summary, the computational complexity of
the proposed HRAIM scheme is O((MK)4).

After using Algorithm 1, we can obtain the clustering
results for M-PVs, i.e., the M-PVs with the same color is
a cluster. Referring to [14], we can prove that in problem
(6), the optimization objective function can be decomposed
into the sum of a convex function and a concave function.
Then we use the Interior Point Method to transform the
inequality constrained convex optimization problem into an
unconstrained problem. Finally, for each cluster, we use the
Concave-Convex Procedure to linearize the concave part so
that the non-convex problem can be solved as a convex
problem. Then we use Newton’s Method to optimize the
transmit powers in problem (6).

proposed HRAIM scheme in terms of sum data rate of
all M-PVs and spectral efficiency. In the simulations, we
assume that the number of PVs in each cluster is 3, and the
distance between platoons is 30 m. Besides, we set the SINR
threshold γmin = 4 dB, the pathloss exponent α = 3, and
the AWGN power σ2 = −30 dBm.
Fig. 3 illustrates the effects of the number of platoons
and the value of individual maximum transmission power
on sum data rate of all M-PVs. Generally, when the number
of platoons increases, the sum data rate of all M-PVs grows.
The reason is that as the number of platoons grows, although
M-PVs need to share RBs with other M-PVs, the M-PVs can
use more RBs at the same time, and thus M-PVs can still
achieve a higher sum data rate. Meanwhile, Fig. 4 presents
that with different value of individual maximum transmission
power, the changes of spectral efficiency of all M-PVs as the
platoons number increases. We can observe that when the
number of platoons increases, the spectral efficiency rises.
This reason is that when we have more platoons, the increase
in the sum data rate of all M-PVs is greater than the increase
in the number of RBs, which contributes to the growth of

spectral efficiency. Specifically, when the number of platoons
is small, the spectral efficiency and the sum data rate of
all M-PVs are the same for HRAIM scheme and traditional
graph-coloring algorithm. This phenomenon is because that
M-PVs have fewer candidate RBs reusing pairs when there
are fewer platoons.
Fig. 5 displays the effects of the inter-vehicle distance and
the value of individual maximum transmission power on sum
data rate of all M-PVs. Generally, given a fixed number of
M-PVs (i.e., RBs), when the inter-vehicle distance increases,
the sum data rate decreases since the inter-vehicle distance
reduces the desired signal power gains. From Fig. 6, we
can observe that the spectral efficiency decreases with the
growth of inter-vehicle distance, since the reduced sum data
rate results in a lower spectral efficiency when the number
of RBs is fixed. Besides, when the inter-vehicle distance
increases, the spectral efficiency and the sum data rate of all
M-PVs are nearly the same for both HRAIM scheme and
traditional graph-coloring algorithm, since the advantage of
cumulative interference management becomes smaller when
the interference influence among M-PVs gets less.
V. Conclusions
This paper studied the joint optimization problem of
spectrum sharing and interference management in multiplatoon scenario. We assumed that L-PVs used the dedicated
RBs when transmitting messages to BS and broadcasting
their CAMs to their M-PVs, respectively. Meanwhile, MPVs reused the RBs with each other to forward their CAMs
to the adjacent M-PVs behind them. To maximize the
spectral efficiency, we transformed the resource allocation
problem into a hypergraph coloring problem. We proposed
a HRAIM scheme to select M-PVs based on their predefined
minimum SINR thresholds. Numerical results illustrated the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of spectral
efficiency and sum data rate.

Abstract—Platoon communications in vehicular networks is
considered to have broad application prospects in improving
road capacity and traffic safety. This paper considers a multiplatoon vehicle scenario, in which platoon vehicles (PVs)
transmit cooperative awareness messages (CAMs) to other PVs
in the same platoon. The leader platoon vehicles (L-PVs)
use dedicated resource blocks (RBs) to communicate with the
base station (BS) and broadcast their CAMs to their member
platoon vehicles (M-PVs). Meanwhile, to increase spectral efficiency and satisfy the communication demands of PVs, we allow
M-PVs to reuse RBs with each other to transmit their CAMs.
Finally, due to the fact that traditional graph can only model
pairwise relations, we utilize hypergraph to model relationship
among several users and propose a Hypergraph-based Resource
Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) scheme
for multi-platoon scenario. Simulation results illustrate that
the proposed scheme shows a better performance in terms of
spectral efficiency and sum data rate when compared with
traditional graph coloring algorithm and random selection
scheme.

I. Introduction
In vehicle-to-everything communications, platoon is considered to be one of the most representative fifth-generation
(5G) use cases, which can enhance traffic efficiency [1].
To support the synchronous control of the platoon, all
platoon vehicles (PVs) should maintain the same speed and
a constant inter-vehicle distance to ensure string stability [2]
[3], which makes the spacing and velocity error of platoon
would not be amplified with the downstream of the platoon. Therefore, it is essential to transmit their cooperative
awareness messages (CAMs) to other PVs. CAMs include
messages about the driving strategy of the platoon such
as speed and acceleration, as well as information about
resource scheduling within the platoon [1]. According to

communication structure of PVs, there are three main control
strategies, i.e., predecessor following control (PFC) strategy,
symmetric bidirectional control (SBC) strategy, predecessorleader following control (PLFC) strategy [4] [5]. Among
them, the PLFC strategy is a major approach, which shows
outstanding performance in improving string stability [5].
Specifically, each member platoon vehicle (M-PV) communicates with the leader platoon vehicle (L-PV) and the
adjacent PV in front of it to ensure string stability.
When PVs transmit their CAMs, they need to occupy
a certain amount of spectrum resources to realize predefined communication quality, e.g., the minimum data rate
requirements. In face of limited spectrum resources, reusing
spectrum is a promising way to enhance spectral efficiency,
which however introduces more interference among vehicles.
In this case, allocating spectrum resources reasonably is critical to improve communication delay and network capacity.
The authors in [6] jointly considered the platoon size and
power consumption of the platoon, and designed a twostep resource allocation strategy based on branch and bound
algorithm. Works in [7] proposed a time division-based
intra-platoon and minimum rate guaranteed inter-platoon
resource allocation mechanisms to allocate resources for
D2D users efficiently within the platoon. However, the joint
optimization problem of resource allocation and interference
management for multi-platoon scenario has not been well
studied.
The traditional graph can tackle the interference problem,
and the ordinary edges can model pairwise relations, which
however is not sufficient in modeling cumulative interference
in wireless networks. Hypergraph is a useful tool to tackle
this challenge, and it has been applied widely in recent
years [8] [9], since the hyperedges in hypergraph can take
into account the cumulative interference from several users.
Specifically, hypergraph coloring algorithm is an approximate and efficient method for resource allocation problem,
in which users can be modeled as vertices, and the interference relationship among multi-users can be constructed
as hyperedges, RBs can be constructed as different colors
[8] [10]. The authors in [11] used a weighted three-partite
interference hypergraph (IHG) to imitate the complex interference and put forward an IHG-based three-dimensional
matching resource allocation protocol. Meanwhile, works
in [12] proposed a hypergraph spectral clustering based

method in non-orthogonal multiple access heterogeneous
network to deal with the serious cumulative interference.
However, at the time of writing, there is no work invoking
the hypergraph coloring algorithm to address the resource
allocation problem in multi-platoon scenario.
Motivated by above discussions, this paper focuses on
resource allocation and interference management in multiplatoon scenario based on hypergraph coloring algorithm.
Main contributions are summarized as follows. Firstly, we
consider a multi-platoon scenario and formulate an optimization problem to maximize the spectral efficiency of
all M-PVs in the scenario. Then we propose a resource
allocation and interference management scheme for multiplatoon based on hypergraph coloring algorithm to solve the
problem. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the
proposed scheme in terms of spectral efficiency and sum
date rate.
II. System Model And Problem Formulation
In this section, we first describe the multi-platoon scenario along with the channel model. Then, we formulate a
general resource allocation problem to maximize the spectral
efficiency for the whole network.
A. System Model
We consider a multi-platoon scenario consisting of M
platoons on a fixed road segment, as shown in Fig. 1. The
i-th platoon is denoted by Vi. The number of PVs in each
platoon is the same, which is denoted by K, and the PVs
in Vi are denoted by Vi = {v1i, v2i, &hellip;, vji, &hellip;, vKi i}. Among
them, v1i is the L-PV and vji is the j-th PV of platoon Vi.
The licensed spectrum is divided into multiple RBs with
unit bandwidth, which can be reused by M-PVs. The MPVs reusing the same RBs are grouped into a cluster, and
the clusters are denoted by R= {r1, r2, &hellip;, rN}. Without
loss of generality, we apply the PLFC strategy in this work,
and give detailed discussions on its two main transmission
processes.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Broadcast process: Firstly, the L-PVs not only need
to receive the information from the BS, such as resource
scheduling messages, but also need to transmit their CAMs
to BS. The corresponding communication links are denoted
with red and orange dotted arrows in Fig. 1. Then L-PVs
broadcast their CAMs to their M-PVs. Due to the broadcast
range is limited, the L-PVs might not be able to cover the
entire platoon in the broadcast process.</li>
<li>V2V communications process: Once the process of the
broadcast is completed, each M-PV will start transmitting its
own CAMs to the adjacent M-PV behind it, the corresponding communication links are denoted with the blue arrow
in Fig. 1. We apply Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD)
mechanism so that M-PVs can transmit and receive CAMs
using different RBs simultaneously. Meanwhile, different
M-PVs can share RBs within controllable interference. By
assuming that each M-PV occupies a dedicated RB, they can
reuse the RBs of all members when they are grouped into
one cluster. For example, three M-PVs in the same cluster
can reuse three RBs simultaneously.
B. Channel Models
It should be noted that the broadcast process and V2V
communications process have different time periods, as
shown in Fig. 1, we mainly focus on resource allocation
and interference management in V2V communications process. We assume that the inter-vehicle distance of different
platoons is same, which is denoted by d0.

To maximize the spectral efficiency of all platoons with
the joint optimization of user clustering and resource allocation, we formulate the optimization problem as

In problem (6), the optimization variables are clustering
matrix XM×K×N and transmission power allocation matrix
PM×K. The total number of RBs used by all PVs is
M(K−2). Constraint (6b) indicates that the SINR of M-PVs
is no less than the minimum SINR requirement. Constraint
(6c) indicates that the transmission power of PVs should not
be larger than the maximum power. Constraint (6d) requires
that each M-PV can only be grouped into a cluster.
The optimization problem (6) is a maximum weighted
matching problem with nonlinear constraints, which is NPhard [13]. When there exist many PVs, exhaustive search
becomes unacceptable with high computational complexity.
Therefore, we propose a Hypergraph-based Resource Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) scheme to
solve the spectral efficiency maximization problem.
III. Hypergraph Based Resource Allocation
In this section, we will first give some preliminaries
about hypergraph theory and coloring algorithm, and then
construct a hypergraph for M-PVs. Finally, we introduce the
HRAIM scheme in detail.
A. Hypergraph Preliminaries
Here, we introduce several necessary definitions of hypergraph in the following [10].
Definition 1: A hypergraph H(X, E) is a vertex set X and
a set of edges E including hyperedges containing more than
two vertices and ordinary edges connecting two vertices.
Definition 2: In a hypergraph H(X, E), a strong deletion
of a vertex x ∈ X from H is to delete x from H and all the
edges containing x from E.
Definition 3: The monodegree of a vertex x is the maximum cardinality of a hyperedge subfamily E1(x) ⊆ E such
that two elements ei, ej ∈ E1(x), ei ∩ ej = x.
In Fig. 2, M-PVs constitute the vertex set, the interference
relationship among M-PVs constitutes ordinary edges set
and hyperedges set. Meanwhile, the set formed by edge 2
and edge 5 is the hyperedge subfamily of vertex x, and the
monodegree of x is 4.

B. Interference Hypergraph Construction
We model M-PVs and the interference relationship among
several M-PVs as vertices and hyperedges, respectively. The
vertices in the same hyperedges represent that the cumulative
interference is so large that they cannot be grouped into
the same cluster. In other words, they cannot be colored
with the same color. As shown as Fig. 2, the M-PVs with
different circles represent that the M-PVs are in different
clusters. In the following, we establish the hypergraph with
the construction of ordinary edges and hyperedges.</li>
<li>Ordinary edges construction: For each vertex vji−1
reusing the same RB with another vehicle vls−1, if the SINR
of this vertex satisfies (7), then we connect two vertices with
an ordinary edge. As shown in Fig. 2, edge 1, edge 2, edge
3, and edge 4 are ordinary edges.

<li>Hyperedges construction: For each vertex vji−1

of this vertex satisfies (8), then we construct a hyperedge for
these vertices. As shown in Fig. 2, edge 5 and edge 6 are
hyperedges.

C. The Hypergraph-based Resource Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) Scheme for Multi-platoon
After constructing the hypergraph, we use hypergraph coloring algorithm to address the resource allocation problem.
In the coloring algorithm, the vertices in the same edge

hypergraph. Then, according to the constructed hypergraph,
we calculate the monodegree for each vertex, and label the
PV which has the minimum monodegree with fL, where L
is the total number of vertices. Next, we strongly delete this
vertex and then get a new hypergraph. Based on this new
hypergraph, we repeat these steps until all vertices are sorted
by their monodegree. Finally, we color these vertices according to F= {f1, f2&hellip;fL} in a color which is in the available
color set. Note that the available color set of a vertex contains
these colors not being used by all vertices in the same
edge. If the available color set is empty, this vertex remains
uncolored. We conclude the HRAIM scheme in Algorithm</li>

From step 4 to step 9, we have a loop with MK iterations.
Since the computational complexity is O((MK)3) from step
4 to step 6, the total complexity from step 4 to step 9 is
O((MK)4). In summary, the computational complexity of
the proposed HRAIM scheme is O((MK)4).

After using Algorithm 1, we can obtain the clustering
results for M-PVs, i.e., the M-PVs with the same color is
a cluster. Referring to [14], we can prove that in problem
(6), the optimization objective function can be decomposed
into the sum of a convex function and a concave function.
Then we use the Interior Point Method to transform the
inequality constrained convex optimization problem into an
unconstrained problem. Finally, for each cluster, we use the
Concave-Convex Procedure to linearize the concave part so
that the non-convex problem can be solved as a convex
problem. Then we use Newton’s Method to optimize the
transmit powers in problem (6).

proposed HRAIM scheme in terms of sum data rate of
all M-PVs and spectral efficiency. In the simulations, we
assume that the number of PVs in each cluster is 3, and the
distance between platoons is 30 m. Besides, we set the SINR
threshold γmin = 4 dB, the pathloss exponent α = 3, and
the AWGN power σ2 = −30 dBm.
Fig. 3 illustrates the effects of the number of platoons
and the value of individual maximum transmission power
on sum data rate of all M-PVs. Generally, when the number
of platoons increases, the sum data rate of all M-PVs grows.
The reason is that as the number of platoons grows, although
M-PVs need to share RBs with other M-PVs, the M-PVs can
use more RBs at the same time, and thus M-PVs can still
achieve a higher sum data rate. Meanwhile, Fig. 4 presents
that with different value of individual maximum transmission
power, the changes of spectral efficiency of all M-PVs as the
platoons number increases. We can observe that when the
number of platoons increases, the spectral efficiency rises.
This reason is that when we have more platoons, the increase
in the sum data rate of all M-PVs is greater than the increase
in the number of RBs, which contributes to the growth of

spectral efficiency. Specifically, when the number of platoons
is small, the spectral efficiency and the sum data rate of
all M-PVs are the same for HRAIM scheme and traditional
graph-coloring algorithm. This phenomenon is because that
M-PVs have fewer candidate RBs reusing pairs when there
are fewer platoons.
Fig. 5 displays the effects of the inter-vehicle distance and
the value of individual maximum transmission power on sum
data rate of all M-PVs. Generally, given a fixed number of
M-PVs (i.e., RBs), when the inter-vehicle distance increases,
the sum data rate decreases since the inter-vehicle distance
reduces the desired signal power gains. From Fig. 6, we
can observe that the spectral efficiency decreases with the
growth of inter-vehicle distance, since the reduced sum data
rate results in a lower spectral efficiency when the number
of RBs is fixed. Besides, when the inter-vehicle distance
increases, the spectral efficiency and the sum data rate of all
M-PVs are nearly the same for both HRAIM scheme and
traditional graph-coloring algorithm, since the advantage of
cumulative interference management becomes smaller when
the interference influence among M-PVs gets less.
V. Conclusions
This paper studied the joint optimization problem of
spectrum sharing and interference management in multiplatoon scenario. We assumed that L-PVs used the dedicated
RBs when transmitting messages to BS and broadcasting
their CAMs to their M-PVs, respectively. Meanwhile, MPVs reused the RBs with each other to forward their CAMs
to the adjacent M-PVs behind them. To maximize the
spectral efficiency, we transformed the resource allocation
problem into a hypergraph coloring problem. We proposed
a HRAIM scheme to select M-PVs based on their predefined
minimum SINR thresholds. Numerical results illustrated the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of spectral
efficiency and sum data rate.

Abstract—Platoon communications in vehicular networks is
considered to have broad application prospects in improving
road capacity and traffic safety. This paper considers a multiplatoon vehicle scenario, in which platoon vehicles (PVs)
transmit cooperative awareness messages (CAMs) to other PVs
in the same platoon. The leader platoon vehicles (L-PVs)
use dedicated resource blocks (RBs) to communicate with the
base station (BS) and broadcast their CAMs to their member
platoon vehicles (M-PVs). Meanwhile, to increase spectral efficiency and satisfy the communication demands of PVs, we allow
M-PVs to reuse RBs with each other to transmit their CAMs.
Finally, due to the fact that traditional graph can only model
pairwise relations, we utilize hypergraph to model relationship
among several users and propose a Hypergraph-based Resource
Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) scheme
for multi-platoon scenario. Simulation results illustrate that
the proposed scheme shows a better performance in terms of
spectral efficiency and sum data rate when compared with
traditional graph coloring algorithm and random selection
scheme.

I. Introduction
In vehicle-to-everything communications, platoon is considered to be one of the most representative fifth-generation
(5G) use cases, which can enhance traffic efficiency [1].
To support the synchronous control of the platoon, all
platoon vehicles (PVs) should maintain the same speed and
a constant inter-vehicle distance to ensure string stability [2]
[3], which makes the spacing and velocity error of platoon
would not be amplified with the downstream of the platoon. Therefore, it is essential to transmit their cooperative
awareness messages (CAMs) to other PVs. CAMs include
messages about the driving strategy of the platoon such
as speed and acceleration, as well as information about
resource scheduling within the platoon [1]. According to

communication structure of PVs, there are three main control
strategies, i.e., predecessor following control (PFC) strategy,
symmetric bidirectional control (SBC) strategy, predecessorleader following control (PLFC) strategy [4] [5]. Among
them, the PLFC strategy is a major approach, which shows
outstanding performance in improving string stability [5].
Specifically, each member platoon vehicle (M-PV) communicates with the leader platoon vehicle (L-PV) and the
adjacent PV in front of it to ensure string stability.
When PVs transmit their CAMs, they need to occupy
a certain amount of spectrum resources to realize predefined communication quality, e.g., the minimum data rate
requirements. In face of limited spectrum resources, reusing
spectrum is a promising way to enhance spectral efficiency,
which however introduces more interference among vehicles.
In this case, allocating spectrum resources reasonably is critical to improve communication delay and network capacity.
The authors in [6] jointly considered the platoon size and
power consumption of the platoon, and designed a twostep resource allocation strategy based on branch and bound
algorithm. Works in [7] proposed a time division-based
intra-platoon and minimum rate guaranteed inter-platoon
resource allocation mechanisms to allocate resources for
D2D users efficiently within the platoon. However, the joint
optimization problem of resource allocation and interference
management for multi-platoon scenario has not been well
studied.
The traditional graph can tackle the interference problem,
and the ordinary edges can model pairwise relations, which
however is not sufficient in modeling cumulative interference
in wireless networks. Hypergraph is a useful tool to tackle
this challenge, and it has been applied widely in recent
years [8] [9], since the hyperedges in hypergraph can take
into account the cumulative interference from several users.
Specifically, hypergraph coloring algorithm is an approximate and efficient method for resource allocation problem,
in which users can be modeled as vertices, and the interference relationship among multi-users can be constructed
as hyperedges, RBs can be constructed as different colors
[8] [10]. The authors in [11] used a weighted three-partite
interference hypergraph (IHG) to imitate the complex interference and put forward an IHG-based three-dimensional
matching resource allocation protocol. Meanwhile, works
in [12] proposed a hypergraph spectral clustering based

method in non-orthogonal multiple access heterogeneous
network to deal with the serious cumulative interference.
However, at the time of writing, there is no work invoking
the hypergraph coloring algorithm to address the resource
allocation problem in multi-platoon scenario.
Motivated by above discussions, this paper focuses on
resource allocation and interference management in multiplatoon scenario based on hypergraph coloring algorithm.
Main contributions are summarized as follows. Firstly, we
consider a multi-platoon scenario and formulate an optimization problem to maximize the spectral efficiency of
all M-PVs in the scenario. Then we propose a resource
allocation and interference management scheme for multiplatoon based on hypergraph coloring algorithm to solve the
problem. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the
proposed scheme in terms of spectral efficiency and sum
date rate.
II. System Model And Problem Formulation
In this section, we first describe the multi-platoon scenario along with the channel model. Then, we formulate a
general resource allocation problem to maximize the spectral
efficiency for the whole network.
A. System Model
We consider a multi-platoon scenario consisting of M
platoons on a fixed road segment, as shown in Fig. 1. The
i-th platoon is denoted by Vi. The number of PVs in each
platoon is the same, which is denoted by K, and the PVs
in Vi are denoted by Vi = {v1i, v2i, &hellip;, vji, &hellip;, vKi i}. Among
them, v1i is the L-PV and vji is the j-th PV of platoon Vi.
The licensed spectrum is divided into multiple RBs with
unit bandwidth, which can be reused by M-PVs. The MPVs reusing the same RBs are grouped into a cluster, and
the clusters are denoted by R= {r1, r2, &hellip;, rN}. Without
loss of generality, we apply the PLFC strategy in this work,
and give detailed discussions on its two main transmission
processes.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Broadcast process: Firstly, the L-PVs not only need
to receive the information from the BS, such as resource
scheduling messages, but also need to transmit their CAMs
to BS. The corresponding communication links are denoted
with red and orange dotted arrows in Fig. 1. Then L-PVs
broadcast their CAMs to their M-PVs. Due to the broadcast
range is limited, the L-PVs might not be able to cover the
entire platoon in the broadcast process.</li>
<li>V2V communications process: Once the process of the
broadcast is completed, each M-PV will start transmitting its
own CAMs to the adjacent M-PV behind it, the corresponding communication links are denoted with the blue arrow
in Fig. 1. We apply Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD)
mechanism so that M-PVs can transmit and receive CAMs
using different RBs simultaneously. Meanwhile, different
M-PVs can share RBs within controllable interference. By
assuming that each M-PV occupies a dedicated RB, they can
reuse the RBs of all members when they are grouped into
one cluster. For example, three M-PVs in the same cluster
can reuse three RBs simultaneously.
B. Channel Models
It should be noted that the broadcast process and V2V
communications process have different time periods, as
shown in Fig. 1, we mainly focus on resource allocation
and interference management in V2V communications process. We assume that the inter-vehicle distance of different
platoons is same, which is denoted by d0.

To maximize the spectral efficiency of all platoons with
the joint optimization of user clustering and resource allocation, we formulate the optimization problem as

In problem (6), the optimization variables are clustering
matrix XM×K×N and transmission power allocation matrix
PM×K. The total number of RBs used by all PVs is
M(K−2). Constraint (6b) indicates that the SINR of M-PVs
is no less than the minimum SINR requirement. Constraint
(6c) indicates that the transmission power of PVs should not
be larger than the maximum power. Constraint (6d) requires
that each M-PV can only be grouped into a cluster.
The optimization problem (6) is a maximum weighted
matching problem with nonlinear constraints, which is NPhard [13]. When there exist many PVs, exhaustive search
becomes unacceptable with high computational complexity.
Therefore, we propose a Hypergraph-based Resource Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) scheme to
solve the spectral efficiency maximization problem.
III. Hypergraph Based Resource Allocation
In this section, we will first give some preliminaries
about hypergraph theory and coloring algorithm, and then
construct a hypergraph for M-PVs. Finally, we introduce the
HRAIM scheme in detail.
A. Hypergraph Preliminaries
Here, we introduce several necessary definitions of hypergraph in the following [10].
Definition 1: A hypergraph H(X, E) is a vertex set X and
a set of edges E including hyperedges containing more than
two vertices and ordinary edges connecting two vertices.
Definition 2: In a hypergraph H(X, E), a strong deletion
of a vertex x ∈ X from H is to delete x from H and all the
edges containing x from E.
Definition 3: The monodegree of a vertex x is the maximum cardinality of a hyperedge subfamily E1(x) ⊆ E such
that two elements ei, ej ∈ E1(x), ei ∩ ej = x.
In Fig. 2, M-PVs constitute the vertex set, the interference
relationship among M-PVs constitutes ordinary edges set
and hyperedges set. Meanwhile, the set formed by edge 2
and edge 5 is the hyperedge subfamily of vertex x, and the
monodegree of x is 4.

B. Interference Hypergraph Construction
We model M-PVs and the interference relationship among
several M-PVs as vertices and hyperedges, respectively. The
vertices in the same hyperedges represent that the cumulative
interference is so large that they cannot be grouped into
the same cluster. In other words, they cannot be colored
with the same color. As shown as Fig. 2, the M-PVs with
different circles represent that the M-PVs are in different
clusters. In the following, we establish the hypergraph with
the construction of ordinary edges and hyperedges.</li>
<li>Ordinary edges construction: For each vertex vji−1
reusing the same RB with another vehicle vls−1, if the SINR
of this vertex satisfies (7), then we connect two vertices with
an ordinary edge. As shown in Fig. 2, edge 1, edge 2, edge
3, and edge 4 are ordinary edges.

these vertices. As shown in Fig. 2, edge 5 and edge 6 are
hyperedges.

C. The Hypergraph-based Resource Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) Scheme for Multi-platoon
After constructing the hypergraph, we use hypergraph coloring algorithm to address the resource allocation problem.
In the coloring algorithm, the vertices in the same edge
should be colored by at least 2 colors. First, according
to the interference relationship among PVs, we establish
ordinary edges and hyperedges with (7) and (8) to construct a

hypergraph. Then, according to the constructed hypergraph,
we calculate the monodegree for each vertex, and label the
PV which has the minimum monodegree with fL, where L
is the total number of vertices. Next, we strongly delete this
vertex and then get a new hypergraph. Based on this new
hypergraph, we repeat these steps until all vertices are sorted
by their monodegree. Finally, we color these vertices according to F= {f1, f2&hellip;fL} in a color which is in the available
color set. Note that the available color set of a vertex contains
these colors not being used by all vertices in the same
edge. If the available color set is empty, this vertex remains
uncolored. We conclude the HRAIM scheme in Algorithm</li>

<li>In Algorithm 1, the computational complexity of step
1 and step 2 are O((MK)2) and O((MK)3), respectively.
From step 4 to step 9, we have a loop with MK iterations.
Since the computational complexity is O((MK)3) from step
4 to step 6, the total complexity from step 4 to step 9 is
O((MK)4). In summary, the computational complexity of
the proposed HRAIM scheme is O((MK)4).

After using Algorithm 1, we can obtain the clustering
results for M-PVs, i.e., the M-PVs with the same color is
a cluster. Referring to [14], we can prove that in problem
(6), the optimization objective function can be decomposed
into the sum of a convex function and a concave function.
Then we use the Interior Point Method to transform the
inequality constrained convex optimization problem into an
unconstrained problem. Finally, for each cluster, we use the
Concave-Convex Procedure to linearize the concave part so
that the non-convex problem can be solved as a convex
problem. Then we use Newton’s Method to optimize the
transmit powers in problem (6).

proposed HRAIM scheme in terms of sum data rate of
all M-PVs and spectral efficiency. In the simulations, we
assume that the number of PVs in each cluster is 3, and the
distance between platoons is 30 m. Besides, we set the SINR
threshold γmin = 4 dB, the pathloss exponent α = 3, and
the AWGN power σ2 = −30 dBm.
Fig. 3 illustrates the effects of the number of platoons
and the value of individual maximum transmission power
on sum data rate of all M-PVs. Generally, when the number
of platoons increases, the sum data rate of all M-PVs grows.
The reason is that as the number of platoons grows, although
M-PVs need to share RBs with other M-PVs, the M-PVs can
use more RBs at the same time, and thus M-PVs can still
achieve a higher sum data rate. Meanwhile, Fig. 4 presents
that with different value of individual maximum transmission
power, the changes of spectral efficiency of all M-PVs as the
platoons number increases. We can observe that when the
number of platoons increases, the spectral efficiency rises.
This reason is that when we have more platoons, the increase
in the sum data rate of all M-PVs is greater than the increase
in the number of RBs, which contributes to the growth of

spectral efficiency. Specifically, when the number of platoons
is small, the spectral efficiency and the sum data rate of
all M-PVs are the same for HRAIM scheme and traditional
graph-coloring algorithm. This phenomenon is because that
M-PVs have fewer candidate RBs reusing pairs when there
are fewer platoons.
Fig. 5 displays the effects of the inter-vehicle distance and
the value of individual maximum transmission power on sum
data rate of all M-PVs. Generally, given a fixed number of
M-PVs (i.e., RBs), when the inter-vehicle distance increases,
the sum data rate decreases since the inter-vehicle distance
reduces the desired signal power gains. From Fig. 6, we
can observe that the spectral efficiency decreases with the
growth of inter-vehicle distance, since the reduced sum data
rate results in a lower spectral efficiency when the number
of RBs is fixed. Besides, when the inter-vehicle distance
increases, the spectral efficiency and the sum data rate of all
M-PVs are nearly the same for both HRAIM scheme and
traditional graph-coloring algorithm, since the advantage of
cumulative interference management becomes smaller when
the interference influence among M-PVs gets less.
V. Conclusions
This paper studied the joint optimization problem of
spectrum sharing and interference management in multiplatoon scenario. We assumed that L-PVs used the dedicated
RBs when transmitting messages to BS and broadcasting
their CAMs to their M-PVs, respectively. Meanwhile, MPVs reused the RBs with each other to forward their CAMs
to the adjacent M-PVs behind them. To maximize the
spectral efficiency, we transformed the resource allocation
problem into a hypergraph coloring problem. We proposed
a HRAIM scheme to select M-PVs based on their predefined
minimum SINR thresholds. Numerical results illustrated the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of spectral
efficiency and sum data rate.

Abstract—Platoon communications in vehicular networks is
considered to have broad application prospects in improving
road capacity and traffic safety. This paper considers a multiplatoon vehicle scenario, in which platoon vehicles (PVs)
transmit cooperative awareness messages (CAMs) to other PVs
in the same platoon. The leader platoon vehicles (L-PVs)
use dedicated resource blocks (RBs) to communicate with the
base station (BS) and broadcast their CAMs to their member
platoon vehicles (M-PVs). Meanwhile, to increase spectral efficiency and satisfy the communication demands of PVs, we allow
M-PVs to reuse RBs with each other to transmit their CAMs.
Finally, due to the fact that traditional graph can only model
pairwise relations, we utilize hypergraph to model relationship
among several users and propose a Hypergraph-based Resource
Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) scheme
for multi-platoon scenario. Simulation results illustrate that
the proposed scheme shows a better performance in terms of
spectral efficiency and sum data rate when compared with
traditional graph coloring algorithm and random selection
scheme.

I. Introduction
In vehicle-to-everything communications, platoon is considered to be one of the most representative fifth-generation
(5G) use cases, which can enhance traffic efficiency [1].
To support the synchronous control of the platoon, all
platoon vehicles (PVs) should maintain the same speed and
a constant inter-vehicle distance to ensure string stability [2]
[3], which makes the spacing and velocity error of platoon
would not be amplified with the downstream of the platoon. Therefore, it is essential to transmit their cooperative
awareness messages (CAMs) to other PVs. CAMs include
messages about the driving strategy of the platoon such
as speed and acceleration, as well as information about
resource scheduling within the platoon [1]. According to

communication structure of PVs, there are three main control
strategies, i.e., predecessor following control (PFC) strategy,
symmetric bidirectional control (SBC) strategy, predecessorleader following control (PLFC) strategy [4] [5]. Among
them, the PLFC strategy is a major approach, which shows
outstanding performance in improving string stability [5].
Specifically, each member platoon vehicle (M-PV) communicates with the leader platoon vehicle (L-PV) and the
adjacent PV in front of it to ensure string stability.
When PVs transmit their CAMs, they need to occupy
a certain amount of spectrum resources to realize predefined communication quality, e.g., the minimum data rate
requirements. In face of limited spectrum resources, reusing
spectrum is a promising way to enhance spectral efficiency,
which however introduces more interference among vehicles.
In this case, allocating spectrum resources reasonably is critical to improve communication delay and network capacity.
The authors in [6] jointly considered the platoon size and
power consumption of the platoon, and designed a twostep resource allocation strategy based on branch and bound
algorithm. Works in [7] proposed a time division-based
intra-platoon and minimum rate guaranteed inter-platoon
resource allocation mechanisms to allocate resources for
D2D users efficiently within the platoon. However, the joint
optimization problem of resource allocation and interference
management for multi-platoon scenario has not been well
studied.
The traditional graph can tackle the interference problem,
and the ordinary edges can model pairwise relations, which
however is not sufficient in modeling cumulative interference
in wireless networks. Hypergraph is a useful tool to tackle
this challenge, and it has been applied widely in recent
years [8] [9], since the hyperedges in hypergraph can take
into account the cumulative interference from several users.
Specifically, hypergraph coloring algorithm is an approximate and efficient method for resource allocation problem,
in which users can be modeled as vertices, and the interference relationship among multi-users can be constructed
as hyperedges, RBs can be constructed as different colors
[8] [10]. The authors in [11] used a weighted three-partite
interference hypergraph (IHG) to imitate the complex interference and put forward an IHG-based three-dimensional
matching resource allocation protocol. Meanwhile, works
in [12] proposed a hypergraph spectral clustering based

method in non-orthogonal multiple access heterogeneous
network to deal with the serious cumulative interference.
However, at the time of writing, there is no work invoking
the hypergraph coloring algorithm to address the resource
allocation problem in multi-platoon scenario.
Motivated by above discussions, this paper focuses on
resource allocation and interference management in multiplatoon scenario based on hypergraph coloring algorithm.
Main contributions are summarized as follows. Firstly, we
consider a multi-platoon scenario and formulate an optimization problem to maximize the spectral efficiency of
all M-PVs in the scenario. Then we propose a resource
allocation and interference management scheme for multiplatoon based on hypergraph coloring algorithm to solve the
problem. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the
proposed scheme in terms of spectral efficiency and sum
date rate.
II. System Model And Problem Formulation
In this section, we first describe the multi-platoon scenario along with the channel model. Then, we formulate a
general resource allocation problem to maximize the spectral
efficiency for the whole network.
A. System Model
We consider a multi-platoon scenario consisting of M
platoons on a fixed road segment, as shown in Fig. 1. The
i-th platoon is denoted by Vi. The number of PVs in each
platoon is the same, which is denoted by K, and the PVs
in Vi are denoted by Vi = {v1i, v2i, &hellip;, vji, &hellip;, vKi i}. Among
them, v1i is the L-PV and vji is the j-th PV of platoon Vi.
The licensed spectrum is divided into multiple RBs with
unit bandwidth, which can be reused by M-PVs. The MPVs reusing the same RBs are grouped into a cluster, and
the clusters are denoted by R= {r1, r2, &hellip;, rN}. Without
loss of generality, we apply the PLFC strategy in this work,
and give detailed discussions on its two main transmission
processes.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Broadcast process: Firstly, the L-PVs not only need
to receive the information from the BS, such as resource
scheduling messages, but also need to transmit their CAMs
to BS. The corresponding communication links are denoted
with red and orange dotted arrows in Fig. 1. Then L-PVs
broadcast their CAMs to their M-PVs. Due to the broadcast
range is limited, the L-PVs might not be able to cover the
entire platoon in the broadcast process.</li>
<li>V2V communications process: Once the process of the
broadcast is completed, each M-PV will start transmitting its
own CAMs to the adjacent M-PV behind it, the corresponding communication links are denoted with the blue arrow
in Fig. 1. We apply Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD)
mechanism so that M-PVs can transmit and receive CAMs
using different RBs simultaneously. Meanwhile, different
M-PVs can share RBs within controllable interference. By
assuming that each M-PV occupies a dedicated RB, they can
reuse the RBs of all members when they are grouped into
one cluster. For example, three M-PVs in the same cluster
can reuse three RBs simultaneously.
B. Channel Models
It should be noted that the broadcast process and V2V
communications process have different time periods, as
shown in Fig. 1, we mainly focus on resource allocation
and interference management in V2V communications process. We assume that the inter-vehicle distance of different
platoons is same, which is denoted by d0.

To maximize the spectral efficiency of all platoons with

In problem (6), the optimization variables are clustering
matrix XM×K×N and transmission power allocation matrix
PM×K. The total number of RBs used by all PVs is
M(K−2). Constraint (6b) indicates that the SINR of M-PVs
is no less than the minimum SINR requirement. Constraint
(6c) indicates that the transmission power of PVs should not
be larger than the maximum power. Constraint (6d) requires
that each M-PV can only be grouped into a cluster.
The optimization problem (6) is a maximum weighted
matching problem with nonlinear constraints, which is NPhard [13]. When there exist many PVs, exhaustive search
becomes unacceptable with high computational complexity.
Therefore, we propose a Hypergraph-based Resource Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) scheme to
solve the spectral efficiency maximization problem.
III. Hypergraph Based Resource Allocation
In this section, we will first give some preliminaries
about hypergraph theory and coloring algorithm, and then
construct a hypergraph for M-PVs. Finally, we introduce the
HRAIM scheme in detail.
A. Hypergraph Preliminaries
Here, we introduce several necessary definitions of hypergraph in the following [10].
Definition 1: A hypergraph H(X, E) is a vertex set X and
a set of edges E including hyperedges containing more than
two vertices and ordinary edges connecting two vertices.
Definition 2: In a hypergraph H(X, E), a strong deletion
of a vertex x ∈ X from H is to delete x from H and all the
edges containing x from E.
Definition 3: The monodegree of a vertex x is the maximum cardinality of a hyperedge subfamily E1(x) ⊆ E such
that two elements ei, ej ∈ E1(x), ei ∩ ej = x.
In Fig. 2, M-PVs constitute the vertex set, the interference
relationship among M-PVs constitutes ordinary edges set
and hyperedges set. Meanwhile, the set formed by edge 2
and edge 5 is the hyperedge subfamily of vertex x, and the
monodegree of x is 4.

B. Interference Hypergraph Construction
We model M-PVs and the interference relationship among
several M-PVs as vertices and hyperedges, respectively. The
vertices in the same hyperedges represent that the cumulative
interference is so large that they cannot be grouped into
the same cluster. In other words, they cannot be colored
with the same color. As shown as Fig. 2, the M-PVs with
different circles represent that the M-PVs are in different
clusters. In the following, we establish the hypergraph with

C. The Hypergraph-based Resource Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) Scheme for Multi-platoon
After constructing the hypergraph, we use hypergraph coloring algorithm to address the resource allocation problem.
In the coloring algorithm, the vertices in the same edge
should be colored by at least 2 colors. First, according
to the interference relationship among PVs, we establish
ordinary edges and hyperedges with (7) and (8) to construct a

hypergraph. Then, according to the constructed hypergraph,
we calculate the monodegree for each vertex, and label the
PV which has the minimum monodegree with fL, where L
is the total number of vertices. Next, we strongly delete this
vertex and then get a new hypergraph. Based on this new
hypergraph, we repeat these steps until all vertices are sorted
by their monodegree. Finally, we color these vertices according to F= {f1, f2&hellip;fL} in a color which is in the available
color set. Note that the available color set of a vertex contains
these colors not being used by all vertices in the same
edge. If the available color set is empty, this vertex remains
uncolored. We conclude the HRAIM scheme in Algorithm</li>

<li>In Algorithm 1, the computational complexity of step
1 and step 2 are O((MK)2) and O((MK)3), respectively.
From step 4 to step 9, we have a loop with MK iterations.
Since the computational complexity is O((MK)3) from step
4 to step 6, the total complexity from step 4 to step 9 is
O((MK)4). In summary, the computational complexity of
the proposed HRAIM scheme is O((MK)4).

After using Algorithm 1, we can obtain the clustering
results for M-PVs, i.e., the M-PVs with the same color is
a cluster. Referring to [14], we can prove that in problem
(6), the optimization objective function can be decomposed
into the sum of a convex function and a concave function.
Then we use the Interior Point Method to transform the
inequality constrained convex optimization problem into an
unconstrained problem. Finally, for each cluster, we use the
Concave-Convex Procedure to linearize the concave part so
that the non-convex problem can be solved as a convex
problem. Then we use Newton’s Method to optimize the
transmit powers in problem (6).

proposed HRAIM scheme in terms of sum data rate of
all M-PVs and spectral efficiency. In the simulations, we
assume that the number of PVs in each cluster is 3, and the
distance between platoons is 30 m. Besides, we set the SINR
threshold γmin = 4 dB, the pathloss exponent α = 3, and
the AWGN power σ2 = −30 dBm.
Fig. 3 illustrates the effects of the number of platoons
and the value of individual maximum transmission power
on sum data rate of all M-PVs. Generally, when the number
of platoons increases, the sum data rate of all M-PVs grows.
The reason is that as the number of platoons grows, although
M-PVs need to share RBs with other M-PVs, the M-PVs can
use more RBs at the same time, and thus M-PVs can still
achieve a higher sum data rate. Meanwhile, Fig. 4 presents
that with different value of individual maximum transmission
power, the changes of spectral efficiency of all M-PVs as the
platoons number increases. We can observe that when the
number of platoons increases, the spectral efficiency rises.
This reason is that when we have more platoons, the increase
in the sum data rate of all M-PVs is greater than the increase
in the number of RBs, which contributes to the growth of

spectral efficiency. Specifically, when the number of platoons
is small, the spectral efficiency and the sum data rate of
all M-PVs are the same for HRAIM scheme and traditional
graph-coloring algorithm. This phenomenon is because that
M-PVs have fewer candidate RBs reusing pairs when there
are fewer platoons.
Fig. 5 displays the effects of the inter-vehicle distance and
the value of individual maximum transmission power on sum
data rate of all M-PVs. Generally, given a fixed number of
M-PVs (i.e., RBs), when the inter-vehicle distance increases,
the sum data rate decreases since the inter-vehicle distance
reduces the desired signal power gains. From Fig. 6, we
can observe that the spectral efficiency decreases with the
growth of inter-vehicle distance, since the reduced sum data
rate results in a lower spectral efficiency when the number
of RBs is fixed. Besides, when the inter-vehicle distance
increases, the spectral efficiency and the sum data rate of all
M-PVs are nearly the same for both HRAIM scheme and
traditional graph-coloring algorithm, since the advantage of
cumulative interference management becomes smaller when
the interference influence among M-PVs gets less.
V. Conclusions
This paper studied the joint optimization problem of
spectrum sharing and interference management in multiplatoon scenario. We assumed that L-PVs used the dedicated
RBs when transmitting messages to BS and broadcasting
their CAMs to their M-PVs, respectively. Meanwhile, MPVs reused the RBs with each other to forward their CAMs
to the adjacent M-PVs behind them. To maximize the
spectral efficiency, we transformed the resource allocation
problem into a hypergraph coloring problem. We proposed
a HRAIM scheme to select M-PVs based on their predefined
minimum SINR thresholds. Numerical results illustrated the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of spectral
efficiency and sum data rate.

Abstract—Platoon communications in vehicular networks is
considered to have broad application prospects in improving
road capacity and traffic safety. This paper considers a multiplatoon vehicle scenario, in which platoon vehicles (PVs)
transmit cooperative awareness messages (CAMs) to other PVs
in the same platoon. The leader platoon vehicles (L-PVs)
use dedicated resource blocks (RBs) to communicate with the
base station (BS) and broadcast their CAMs to their member
platoon vehicles (M-PVs). Meanwhile, to increase spectral efficiency and satisfy the communication demands of PVs, we allow
M-PVs to reuse RBs with each other to transmit their CAMs.
Finally, due to the fact that traditional graph can only model
pairwise relations, we utilize hypergraph to model relationship
among several users and propose a Hypergraph-based Resource
Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) scheme
for multi-platoon scenario. Simulation results illustrate that
the proposed scheme shows a better performance in terms of
spectral efficiency and sum data rate when compared with
traditional graph coloring algorithm and random selection
scheme.

I. Introduction
In vehicle-to-everything communications, platoon is considered to be one of the most representative fifth-generation
(5G) use cases, which can enhance traffic efficiency [1].
To support the synchronous control of the platoon, all
platoon vehicles (PVs) should maintain the same speed and
a constant inter-vehicle distance to ensure string stability [2]
[3], which makes the spacing and velocity error of platoon
would not be amplified with the downstream of the platoon. Therefore, it is essential to transmit their cooperative
awareness messages (CAMs) to other PVs. CAMs include
messages about the driving strategy of the platoon such
as speed and acceleration, as well as information about
resource scheduling within the platoon [1]. According to

communication structure of PVs, there are three main control
strategies, i.e., predecessor following control (PFC) strategy,
symmetric bidirectional control (SBC) strategy, predecessorleader following control (PLFC) strategy [4] [5]. Among
them, the PLFC strategy is a major approach, which shows
outstanding performance in improving string stability [5].
Specifically, each member platoon vehicle (M-PV) communicates with the leader platoon vehicle (L-PV) and the
adjacent PV in front of it to ensure string stability.
When PVs transmit their CAMs, they need to occupy
a certain amount of spectrum resources to realize predefined communication quality, e.g., the minimum data rate
requirements. In face of limited spectrum resources, reusing
spectrum is a promising way to enhance spectral efficiency,
which however introduces more interference among vehicles.
In this case, allocating spectrum resources reasonably is critical to improve communication delay and network capacity.
The authors in [6] jointly considered the platoon size and
power consumption of the platoon, and designed a twostep resource allocation strategy based on branch and bound
algorithm. Works in [7] proposed a time division-based
intra-platoon and minimum rate guaranteed inter-platoon
resource allocation mechanisms to allocate resources for
D2D users efficiently within the platoon. However, the joint
optimization problem of resource allocation and interference
management for multi-platoon scenario has not been well
studied.
The traditional graph can tackle the interference problem,
and the ordinary edges can model pairwise relations, which
however is not sufficient in modeling cumulative interference
in wireless networks. Hypergraph is a useful tool to tackle
this challenge, and it has been applied widely in recent
years [8] [9], since the hyperedges in hypergraph can take
into account the cumulative interference from several users.
Specifically, hypergraph coloring algorithm is an approximate and efficient method for resource allocation problem,
in which users can be modeled as vertices, and the interference relationship among multi-users can be constructed
as hyperedges, RBs can be constructed as different colors
[8] [10]. The authors in [11] used a weighted three-partite
interference hypergraph (IHG) to imitate the complex interference and put forward an IHG-based three-dimensional
matching resource allocation protocol. Meanwhile, works
in [12] proposed a hypergraph spectral clustering based

method in non-orthogonal multiple access heterogeneous
network to deal with the serious cumulative interference.
However, at the time of writing, there is no work invoking
the hypergraph coloring algorithm to address the resource
allocation problem in multi-platoon scenario.
Motivated by above discussions, this paper focuses on
resource allocation and interference management in multiplatoon scenario based on hypergraph coloring algorithm.
Main contributions are summarized as follows. Firstly, we
consider a multi-platoon scenario and formulate an optimization problem to maximize the spectral efficiency of
all M-PVs in the scenario. Then we propose a resource
allocation and interference management scheme for multiplatoon based on hypergraph coloring algorithm to solve the
problem. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the
proposed scheme in terms of spectral efficiency and sum
date rate.
II. System Model And Problem Formulation
In this section, we first describe the multi-platoon scenario along with the channel model. Then, we formulate a
general resource allocation problem to maximize the spectral
efficiency for the whole network.
A. System Model
We consider a multi-platoon scenario consisting of M
platoons on a fixed road segment, as shown in Fig. 1. The
i-th platoon is denoted by Vi. The number of PVs in each
platoon is the same, which is denoted by K, and the PVs
in Vi are denoted by Vi = {v1i, v2i, &hellip;, vji, &hellip;, vKi i}. Among
them, v1i is the L-PV and vji is the j-th PV of platoon Vi.
The licensed spectrum is divided into multiple RBs with
unit bandwidth, which can be reused by M-PVs. The MPVs reusing the same RBs are grouped into a cluster, and
the clusters are denoted by R= {r1, r2, &hellip;, rN}. Without
loss of generality, we apply the PLFC strategy in this work,
and give detailed discussions on its two main transmission
processes.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Broadcast process: Firstly, the L-PVs not only need
to receive the information from the BS, such as resource
scheduling messages, but also need to transmit their CAMs
to BS. The corresponding communication links are denoted
with red and orange dotted arrows in Fig. 1. Then L-PVs
broadcast their CAMs to their M-PVs. Due to the broadcast
range is limited, the L-PVs might not be able to cover the
entire platoon in the broadcast process.</li>
<li>V2V communications process: Once the process of the
broadcast is completed, each M-PV will start transmitting its
own CAMs to the adjacent M-PV behind it, the corresponding communication links are denoted with the blue arrow
in Fig. 1. We apply Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD)
mechanism so that M-PVs can transmit and receive CAMs
using different RBs simultaneously. Meanwhile, different
M-PVs can share RBs within controllable interference. By
assuming that each M-PV occupies a dedicated RB, they can
reuse the RBs of all members when they are grouped into
one cluster. For example, three M-PVs in the same cluster
can reuse three RBs simultaneously.
B. Channel Models
It should be noted that the broadcast process and V2V
communications process have different time periods, as
shown in Fig. 1, we mainly focus on resource allocation
and interference management in V2V communications process. We assume that the inter-vehicle distance of different
platoons is same, which is denoted by d0.

In problem (6), the optimization variables are clustering
matrix XM×K×N and transmission power allocation matrix
PM×K. The total number of RBs used by all PVs is
M(K−2). Constraint (6b) indicates that the SINR of M-PVs
is no less than the minimum SINR requirement. Constraint
(6c) indicates that the transmission power of PVs should not
be larger than the maximum power. Constraint (6d) requires
that each M-PV can only be grouped into a cluster.
The optimization problem (6) is a maximum weighted
matching problem with nonlinear constraints, which is NPhard [13]. When there exist many PVs, exhaustive search
becomes unacceptable with high computational complexity.
Therefore, we propose a Hypergraph-based Resource Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) scheme to
solve the spectral efficiency maximization problem.
III. Hypergraph Based Resource Allocation
In this section, we will first give some preliminaries
about hypergraph theory and coloring algorithm, and then
construct a hypergraph for M-PVs. Finally, we introduce the
HRAIM scheme in detail.
A. Hypergraph Preliminaries
Here, we introduce several necessary definitions of hypergraph in the following [10].
Definition 1: A hypergraph H(X, E) is a vertex set X and
a set of edges E including hyperedges containing more than
two vertices and ordinary edges connecting two vertices.
Definition 2: In a hypergraph H(X, E), a strong deletion
of a vertex x ∈ X from H is to delete x from H and all the
edges containing x from E.
Definition 3: The monodegree of a vertex x is the maximum cardinality of a hyperedge subfamily E1(x) ⊆ E such
that two elements ei, ej ∈ E1(x), ei ∩ ej = x.
In Fig. 2, M-PVs constitute the vertex set, the interference
relationship among M-PVs constitutes ordinary edges set
and hyperedges set. Meanwhile, the set formed by edge 2
and edge 5 is the hyperedge subfamily of vertex x, and the
monodegree of x is 4.

B. Interference Hypergraph Construction
We model M-PVs and the interference relationship among
several M-PVs as vertices and hyperedges, respectively. The
vertices in the same hyperedges represent that the cumulative
interference is so large that they cannot be grouped into
the same cluster. In other words, they cannot be colored
with the same color. As shown as Fig. 2, the M-PVs with
different circles represent that the M-PVs are in different
clusters. In the following, we establish the hypergraph with
the construction of ordinary edges and hyperedges.</li>
<li>Ordinary edges construction: For each vertex vji−1
reusing the same RB with another vehicle vls−1, if the SINR
of this vertex satisfies (7), then we connect two vertices with
an ordinary edge. As shown in Fig. 2, edge 1, edge 2, edge
3, and edge 4 are ordinary edges.

C. The Hypergraph-based Resource Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) Scheme for Multi-platoon
After constructing the hypergraph, we use hypergraph coloring algorithm to address the resource allocation problem.
In the coloring algorithm, the vertices in the same edge
should be colored by at least 2 colors. First, according
to the interference relationship among PVs, we establish
ordinary edges and hyperedges with (7) and (8) to construct a

hypergraph. Then, according to the constructed hypergraph,
we calculate the monodegree for each vertex, and label the
PV which has the minimum monodegree with fL, where L
is the total number of vertices. Next, we strongly delete this
vertex and then get a new hypergraph. Based on this new
hypergraph, we repeat these steps until all vertices are sorted
by their monodegree. Finally, we color these vertices according to F= {f1, f2&hellip;fL} in a color which is in the available
color set. Note that the available color set of a vertex contains
these colors not being used by all vertices in the same
edge. If the available color set is empty, this vertex remains
uncolored. We conclude the HRAIM scheme in Algorithm</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>In Algorithm 1, the computational complexity of step
1 and step 2 are O((MK)2) and O((MK)3), respectively.
From step 4 to step 9, we have a loop with MK iterations.
Since the computational complexity is O((MK)3) from step
4 to step 6, the total complexity from step 4 to step 9 is
O((MK)4). In summary, the computational complexity of
the proposed HRAIM scheme is O((MK)4).

After using Algorithm 1, we can obtain the clustering
results for M-PVs, i.e., the M-PVs with the same color is
a cluster. Referring to [14], we can prove that in problem
(6), the optimization objective function can be decomposed
into the sum of a convex function and a concave function.
Then we use the Interior Point Method to transform the
inequality constrained convex optimization problem into an
unconstrained problem. Finally, for each cluster, we use the
Concave-Convex Procedure to linearize the concave part so
that the non-convex problem can be solved as a convex
problem. Then we use Newton’s Method to optimize the
transmit powers in problem (6).

proposed HRAIM scheme in terms of sum data rate of
all M-PVs and spectral efficiency. In the simulations, we
assume that the number of PVs in each cluster is 3, and the
distance between platoons is 30 m. Besides, we set the SINR
threshold γmin = 4 dB, the pathloss exponent α = 3, and
the AWGN power σ2 = −30 dBm.
Fig. 3 illustrates the effects of the number of platoons
and the value of individual maximum transmission power
on sum data rate of all M-PVs. Generally, when the number
of platoons increases, the sum data rate of all M-PVs grows.
The reason is that as the number of platoons grows, although
M-PVs need to share RBs with other M-PVs, the M-PVs can
use more RBs at the same time, and thus M-PVs can still
achieve a higher sum data rate. Meanwhile, Fig. 4 presents
that with different value of individual maximum transmission
power, the changes of spectral efficiency of all M-PVs as the
platoons number increases. We can observe that when the
number of platoons increases, the spectral efficiency rises.
This reason is that when we have more platoons, the increase
in the sum data rate of all M-PVs is greater than the increase
in the number of RBs, which contributes to the growth of

spectral efficiency. Specifically, when the number of platoons
is small, the spectral efficiency and the sum data rate of
all M-PVs are the same for HRAIM scheme and traditional
graph-coloring algorithm. This phenomenon is because that
M-PVs have fewer candidate RBs reusing pairs when there
are fewer platoons.
Fig. 5 displays the effects of the inter-vehicle distance and
the value of individual maximum transmission power on sum
data rate of all M-PVs. Generally, given a fixed number of
M-PVs (i.e., RBs), when the inter-vehicle distance increases,
the sum data rate decreases since the inter-vehicle distance
reduces the desired signal power gains. From Fig. 6, we
can observe that the spectral efficiency decreases with the
growth of inter-vehicle distance, since the reduced sum data
rate results in a lower spectral efficiency when the number
of RBs is fixed. Besides, when the inter-vehicle distance
increases, the spectral efficiency and the sum data rate of all
M-PVs are nearly the same for both HRAIM scheme and
traditional graph-coloring algorithm, since the advantage of
cumulative interference management becomes smaller when
the interference influence among M-PVs gets less.
V. Conclusions
This paper studied the joint optimization problem of
spectrum sharing and interference management in multiplatoon scenario. We assumed that L-PVs used the dedicated
RBs when transmitting messages to BS and broadcasting
their CAMs to their M-PVs, respectively. Meanwhile, MPVs reused the RBs with each other to forward their CAMs
to the adjacent M-PVs behind them. To maximize the
spectral efficiency, we transformed the resource allocation
problem into a hypergraph coloring problem. We proposed
a HRAIM scheme to select M-PVs based on their predefined
minimum SINR thresholds. Numerical results illustrated the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of spectral
efficiency and sum data rate.

Abstract—Platoon communications in vehicular networks is
considered to have broad application prospects in improving
road capacity and traffic safety. This paper considers a multiplatoon vehicle scenario, in which platoon vehicles (PVs)
transmit cooperative awareness messages (CAMs) to other PVs
in the same platoon. The leader platoon vehicles (L-PVs)
use dedicated resource blocks (RBs) to communicate with the
base station (BS) and broadcast their CAMs to their member
platoon vehicles (M-PVs). Meanwhile, to increase spectral efficiency and satisfy the communication demands of PVs, we allow
M-PVs to reuse RBs with each other to transmit their CAMs.
Finally, due to the fact that traditional graph can only model
pairwise relations, we utilize hypergraph to model relationship
among several users and propose a Hypergraph-based Resource
Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) scheme
for multi-platoon scenario. Simulation results illustrate that
the proposed scheme shows a better performance in terms of
spectral efficiency and sum data rate when compared with
traditional graph coloring algorithm and random selection
scheme.

I. Introduction
In vehicle-to-everything communications, platoon is considered to be one of the most representative fifth-generation
(5G) use cases, which can enhance traffic efficiency [1].
To support the synchronous control of the platoon, all
platoon vehicles (PVs) should maintain the same speed and
a constant inter-vehicle distance to ensure string stability [2]
[3], which makes the spacing and velocity error of platoon
would not be amplified with the downstream of the platoon. Therefore, it is essential to transmit their cooperative
awareness messages (CAMs) to other PVs. CAMs include
messages about the driving strategy of the platoon such
as speed and acceleration, as well as information about
resource scheduling within the platoon [1]. According to

communication structure of PVs, there are three main control
strategies, i.e., predecessor following control (PFC) strategy,
symmetric bidirectional control (SBC) strategy, predecessorleader following control (PLFC) strategy [4] [5]. Among
them, the PLFC strategy is a major approach, which shows
outstanding performance in improving string stability [5].
Specifically, each member platoon vehicle (M-PV) communicates with the leader platoon vehicle (L-PV) and the
adjacent PV in front of it to ensure string stability.
When PVs transmit their CAMs, they need to occupy
a certain amount of spectrum resources to realize predefined communication quality, e.g., the minimum data rate
requirements. In face of limited spectrum resources, reusing
spectrum is a promising way to enhance spectral efficiency,
which however introduces more interference among vehicles.
In this case, allocating spectrum resources reasonably is critical to improve communication delay and network capacity.
The authors in [6] jointly considered the platoon size and
power consumption of the platoon, and designed a twostep resource allocation strategy based on branch and bound
algorithm. Works in [7] proposed a time division-based
intra-platoon and minimum rate guaranteed inter-platoon
resource allocation mechanisms to allocate resources for
D2D users efficiently within the platoon. However, the joint
optimization problem of resource allocation and interference
management for multi-platoon scenario has not been well
studied.
The traditional graph can tackle the interference problem,
and the ordinary edges can model pairwise relations, which
however is not sufficient in modeling cumulative interference
in wireless networks. Hypergraph is a useful tool to tackle
this challenge, and it has been applied widely in recent
years [8] [9], since the hyperedges in hypergraph can take
into account the cumulative interference from several users.
Specifically, hypergraph coloring algorithm is an approximate and efficient method for resource allocation problem,
in which users can be modeled as vertices, and the interference relationship among multi-users can be constructed
as hyperedges, RBs can be constructed as different colors
[8] [10]. The authors in [11] used a weighted three-partite
interference hypergraph (IHG) to imitate the complex interference and put forward an IHG-based three-dimensional
matching resource allocation protocol. Meanwhile, works
in [12] proposed a hypergraph spectral clustering based

method in non-orthogonal multiple access heterogeneous
network to deal with the serious cumulative interference.
However, at the time of writing, there is no work invoking
the hypergraph coloring algorithm to address the resource
allocation problem in multi-platoon scenario.
Motivated by above discussions, this paper focuses on
resource allocation and interference management in multiplatoon scenario based on hypergraph coloring algorithm.
Main contributions are summarized as follows. Firstly, we
consider a multi-platoon scenario and formulate an optimization problem to maximize the spectral efficiency of
all M-PVs in the scenario. Then we propose a resource
allocation and interference management scheme for multiplatoon based on hypergraph coloring algorithm to solve the
problem. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the
proposed scheme in terms of spectral efficiency and sum
date rate.
II. System Model And Problem Formulation
In this section, we first describe the multi-platoon scenario along with the channel model. Then, we formulate a
general resource allocation problem to maximize the spectral
efficiency for the whole network.
A. System Model
We consider a multi-platoon scenario consisting of M
platoons on a fixed road segment, as shown in Fig. 1. The
i-th platoon is denoted by Vi. The number of PVs in each
platoon is the same, which is denoted by K, and the PVs
in Vi are denoted by Vi = {v1i, v2i, &hellip;, vji, &hellip;, vKi i}. Among
them, v1i is the L-PV and vji is the j-th PV of platoon Vi.
The licensed spectrum is divided into multiple RBs with
unit bandwidth, which can be reused by M-PVs. The MPVs reusing the same RBs are grouped into a cluster, and
the clusters are denoted by R= {r1, r2, &hellip;, rN}. Without
loss of generality, we apply the PLFC strategy in this work,
and give detailed discussions on its two main transmission
processes.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Broadcast process: Firstly, the L-PVs not only need
to receive the information from the BS, such as resource
scheduling messages, but also need to transmit their CAMs
to BS. The corresponding communication links are denoted
with red and orange dotted arrows in Fig. 1. Then L-PVs
broadcast their CAMs to their M-PVs. Due to the broadcast
range is limited, the L-PVs might not be able to cover the
entire platoon in the broadcast process.</li>
<li>V2V communications process: Once the process of the
broadcast is completed, each M-PV will start transmitting its
own CAMs to the adjacent M-PV behind it, the corresponding communication links are denoted with the blue arrow
in Fig. 1. We apply Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD)
mechanism so that M-PVs can transmit and receive CAMs
using different RBs simultaneously. Meanwhile, different
M-PVs can share RBs within controllable interference. By
assuming that each M-PV occupies a dedicated RB, they can
reuse the RBs of all members when they are grouped into
one cluster. For example, three M-PVs in the same cluster
can reuse three RBs simultaneously.
B. Channel Models
It should be noted that the broadcast process and V2V
communications process have different time periods, as
shown in Fig. 1, we mainly focus on resource allocation
and interference management in V2V communications process. We assume that the inter-vehicle distance of different
platoons is same, which is denoted by d0.

To maximize the spectral efficiency of all platoons with
the joint optimization of user clustering and resource allocation, we formulate the optimization problem as

In problem (6), the optimization variables are clustering
matrix XM×K×N and transmission power allocation matrix
PM×K. The total number of RBs used by all PVs is
M(K−2). Constraint (6b) indicates that the SINR of M-PVs
is no less than the minimum SINR requirement. Constraint
(6c) indicates that the transmission power of PVs should not
be larger than the maximum power. Constraint (6d) requires
that each M-PV can only be grouped into a cluster.
The optimization problem (6) is a maximum weighted
matching problem with nonlinear constraints, which is NPhard [13]. When there exist many PVs, exhaustive search
becomes unacceptable with high computational complexity.
Therefore, we propose a Hypergraph-based Resource Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) scheme to
solve the spectral efficiency maximization problem.
III. Hypergraph Based Resource Allocation
In this section, we will first give some preliminaries
about hypergraph theory and coloring algorithm, and then
construct a hypergraph for M-PVs. Finally, we introduce the
HRAIM scheme in detail.
A. Hypergraph Preliminaries
Here, we introduce several necessary definitions of hypergraph in the following [10].
Definition 1: A hypergraph H(X, E) is a vertex set X and
a set of edges E including hyperedges containing more than
two vertices and ordinary edges connecting two vertices.
Definition 2: In a hypergraph H(X, E), a strong deletion
of a vertex x ∈ X from H is to delete x from H and all the
edges containing x from E.
Definition 3: The monodegree of a vertex x is the maximum cardinality of a hyperedge subfamily E1(x) ⊆ E such
that two elements ei, ej ∈ E1(x), ei ∩ ej = x.
In Fig. 2, M-PVs constitute the vertex set, the interference
relationship among M-PVs constitutes ordinary edges set
and hyperedges set. Meanwhile, the set formed by edge 2
and edge 5 is the hyperedge subfamily of vertex x, and the
monodegree of x is 4.

B. Interference Hypergraph Construction
We model M-PVs and the interference relationship among
several M-PVs as vertices and hyperedges, respectively. The
vertices in the same hyperedges represent that the cumulative
interference is so large that they cannot be grouped into
the same cluster. In other words, they cannot be colored
with the same color. As shown as Fig. 2, the M-PVs with
different circles represent that the M-PVs are in different
clusters. In the following, we establish the hypergraph with
the construction of ordinary edges and hyperedges.</li>
<li>Ordinary edges construction: For each vertex vji−1
reusing the same RB with another vehicle vls−1, if the SINR
of this vertex satisfies (7), then we connect two vertices with
an ordinary edge. As shown in Fig. 2, edge 1, edge 2, edge
3, and edge 4 are ordinary edges.

these vertices. As shown in Fig. 2, edge 5 and edge 6 are
hyperedges.

C. The Hypergraph-based Resource Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) Scheme for Multi-platoon
After constructing the hypergraph, we use hypergraph coloring algorithm to address the resource allocation problem.
In the coloring algorithm, the vertices in the same edge
should be colored by at least 2 colors. First, according
to the interference relationship among PVs, we establish
ordinary edges and hyperedges with (7) and (8) to construct a

hypergraph. Then, according to the constructed hypergraph,
we calculate the monodegree for each vertex, and label the
PV which has the minimum monodegree with fL, where L
is the total number of vertices. Next, we strongly delete this
vertex and then get a new hypergraph. Based on this new
hypergraph, we repeat these steps until all vertices are sorted
by their monodegree. Finally, we color these vertices according to F= {f1, f2&hellip;fL} in a color which is in the available
color set. Note that the available color set of a vertex contains
these colors not being used by all vertices in the same
edge. If the available color set is empty, this vertex remains
uncolored. We conclude the HRAIM scheme in Algorithm</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>In Algorithm 1, the computational complexity of step
1 and step 2 are O((MK)2) and O((MK)3), respectively.
From step 4 to step 9, we have a loop with MK iterations.
Since the computational complexity is O((MK)3) from step
4 to step 6, the total complexity from step 4 to step 9 is
O((MK)4). In summary, the computational complexity of
the proposed HRAIM scheme is O((MK)4).

After using Algorithm 1, we can obtain the clustering
results for M-PVs, i.e., the M-PVs with the same color is
a cluster. Referring to [14], we can prove that in problem
(6), the optimization objective function can be decomposed
into the sum of a convex function and a concave function.
Then we use the Interior Point Method to transform the
inequality constrained convex optimization problem into an
unconstrained problem. Finally, for each cluster, we use the
Concave-Convex Procedure to linearize the concave part so
that the non-convex problem can be solved as a convex
problem. Then we use Newton’s Method to optimize the
transmit powers in problem (6).

proposed HRAIM scheme in terms of sum data rate of
all M-PVs and spectral efficiency. In the simulations, we
assume that the number of PVs in each cluster is 3, and the
distance between platoons is 30 m. Besides, we set the SINR
threshold γmin = 4 dB, the pathloss exponent α = 3, and
the AWGN power σ2 = −30 dBm.
Fig. 3 illustrates the effects of the number of platoons
and the value of individual maximum transmission power
on sum data rate of all M-PVs. Generally, when the number
of platoons increases, the sum data rate of all M-PVs grows.
The reason is that as the number of platoons grows, although
M-PVs need to share RBs with other M-PVs, the M-PVs can
use more RBs at the same time, and thus M-PVs can still
achieve a higher sum data rate. Meanwhile, Fig. 4 presents
that with different value of individual maximum transmission
power, the changes of spectral efficiency of all M-PVs as the
platoons number increases. We can observe that when the
number of platoons increases, the spectral efficiency rises.
This reason is that when we have more platoons, the increase
in the sum data rate of all M-PVs is greater than the increase
in the number of RBs, which contributes to the growth of

spectral efficiency. Specifically, when the number of platoons
is small, the spectral efficiency and the sum data rate of
all M-PVs are the same for HRAIM scheme and traditional
graph-coloring algorithm. This phenomenon is because that
M-PVs have fewer candidate RBs reusing pairs when there
are fewer platoons.
Fig. 5 displays the effects of the inter-vehicle distance and
the value of individual maximum transmission power on sum
data rate of all M-PVs. Generally, given a fixed number of
M-PVs (i.e., RBs), when the inter-vehicle distance increases,
the sum data rate decreases since the inter-vehicle distance
reduces the desired signal power gains. From Fig. 6, we
can observe that the spectral efficiency decreases with the
growth of inter-vehicle distance, since the reduced sum data
rate results in a lower spectral efficiency when the number
of RBs is fixed. Besides, when the inter-vehicle distance
increases, the spectral efficiency and the sum data rate of all
M-PVs are nearly the same for both HRAIM scheme and
traditional graph-coloring algorithm, since the advantage of
cumulative interference management becomes smaller when
the interference influence among M-PVs gets less.
V. Conclusions
This paper studied the joint optimization problem of
spectrum sharing and interference management in multiplatoon scenario. We assumed that L-PVs used the dedicated
RBs when transmitting messages to BS and broadcasting
their CAMs to their M-PVs, respectively. Meanwhile, MPVs reused the RBs with each other to forward their CAMs
to the adjacent M-PVs behind them. To maximize the
spectral efficiency, we transformed the resource allocation
problem into a hypergraph coloring problem. We proposed
a HRAIM scheme to select M-PVs based on their predefined
minimum SINR thresholds. Numerical results illustrated the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of spectral
efficiency and sum data rate.

Abstract—Platoon communications in vehicular networks is
considered to have broad application prospects in improving
road capacity and traffic safety. This paper considers a multiplatoon vehicle scenario, in which platoon vehicles (PVs)
transmit cooperative awareness messages (CAMs) to other PVs
in the same platoon. The leader platoon vehicles (L-PVs)
use dedicated resource blocks (RBs) to communicate with the
base station (BS) and broadcast their CAMs to their member
platoon vehicles (M-PVs). Meanwhile, to increase spectral efficiency and satisfy the communication demands of PVs, we allow
M-PVs to reuse RBs with each other to transmit their CAMs.
Finally, due to the fact that traditional graph can only model
pairwise relations, we utilize hypergraph to model relationship
among several users and propose a Hypergraph-based Resource
Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) scheme
for multi-platoon scenario. Simulation results illustrate that
the proposed scheme shows a better performance in terms of
spectral efficiency and sum data rate when compared with
traditional graph coloring algorithm and random selection
scheme.

I. Introduction
In vehicle-to-everything communications, platoon is considered to be one of the most representative fifth-generation
(5G) use cases, which can enhance traffic efficiency [1].
To support the synchronous control of the platoon, all
platoon vehicles (PVs) should maintain the same speed and
a constant inter-vehicle distance to ensure string stability [2]
[3], which makes the spacing and velocity error of platoon
would not be amplified with the downstream of the platoon. Therefore, it is essential to transmit their cooperative
awareness messages (CAMs) to other PVs. CAMs include
messages about the driving strategy of the platoon such
as speed and acceleration, as well as information about
resource scheduling within the platoon [1]. According to

communication structure of PVs, there are three main control
strategies, i.e., predecessor following control (PFC) strategy,
symmetric bidirectional control (SBC) strategy, predecessorleader following control (PLFC) strategy [4] [5]. Among
them, the PLFC strategy is a major approach, which shows
outstanding performance in improving string stability [5].
Specifically, each member platoon vehicle (M-PV) communicates with the leader platoon vehicle (L-PV) and the
adjacent PV in front of it to ensure string stability.
When PVs transmit their CAMs, they need to occupy
a certain amount of spectrum resources to realize predefined communication quality, e.g., the minimum data rate
requirements. In face of limited spectrum resources, reusing
spectrum is a promising way to enhance spectral efficiency,
which however introduces more interference among vehicles.
In this case, allocating spectrum resources reasonably is critical to improve communication delay and network capacity.
The authors in [6] jointly considered the platoon size and
power consumption of the platoon, and designed a twostep resource allocation strategy based on branch and bound
algorithm. Works in [7] proposed a time division-based
intra-platoon and minimum rate guaranteed inter-platoon
resource allocation mechanisms to allocate resources for
D2D users efficiently within the platoon. However, the joint
optimization problem of resource allocation and interference
management for multi-platoon scenario has not been well
studied.
The traditional graph can tackle the interference problem,
and the ordinary edges can model pairwise relations, which
however is not sufficient in modeling cumulative interference
in wireless networks. Hypergraph is a useful tool to tackle
this challenge, and it has been applied widely in recent
years [8] [9], since the hyperedges in hypergraph can take
into account the cumulative interference from several users.
Specifically, hypergraph coloring algorithm is an approximate and efficient method for resource allocation problem,
in which users can be modeled as vertices, and the interference relationship among multi-users can be constructed
as hyperedges, RBs can be constructed as different colors
[8] [10]. The authors in [11] used a weighted three-partite
interference hypergraph (IHG) to imitate the complex interference and put forward an IHG-based three-dimensional
matching resource allocation protocol. Meanwhile, works
in [12] proposed a hypergraph spectral clustering based

method in non-orthogonal multiple access heterogeneous
network to deal with the serious cumulative interference.
However, at the time of writing, there is no work invoking
the hypergraph coloring algorithm to address the resource
allocation problem in multi-platoon scenario.
Motivated by above discussions, this paper focuses on
resource allocation and interference management in multiplatoon scenario based on hypergraph coloring algorithm.
Main contributions are summarized as follows. Firstly, we
consider a multi-platoon scenario and formulate an optimization problem to maximize the spectral efficiency of
all M-PVs in the scenario. Then we propose a resource
allocation and interference management scheme for multiplatoon based on hypergraph coloring algorithm to solve the
problem. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the
proposed scheme in terms of spectral efficiency and sum
date rate.
II. System Model And Problem Formulation
In this section, we first describe the multi-platoon scenario along with the channel model. Then, we formulate a
general resource allocation problem to maximize the spectral
efficiency for the whole network.
A. System Model
We consider a multi-platoon scenario consisting of M
platoons on a fixed road segment, as shown in Fig. 1. The
i-th platoon is denoted by Vi. The number of PVs in each
platoon is the same, which is denoted by K, and the PVs
in Vi are denoted by Vi = {v1i, v2i, &hellip;, vji, &hellip;, vKi i}. Among
them, v1i is the L-PV and vji is the j-th PV of platoon Vi.
The licensed spectrum is divided into multiple RBs with
unit bandwidth, which can be reused by M-PVs. The MPVs reusing the same RBs are grouped into a cluster, and
the clusters are denoted by R= {r1, r2, &hellip;, rN}. Without
loss of generality, we apply the PLFC strategy in this work,
and give detailed discussions on its two main transmission
processes.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Broadcast process: Firstly, the L-PVs not only need
to receive the information from the BS, such as resource
scheduling messages, but also need to transmit their CAMs
to BS. The corresponding communication links are denoted
with red and orange dotted arrows in Fig. 1. Then L-PVs
broadcast their CAMs to their M-PVs. Due to the broadcast
range is limited, the L-PVs might not be able to cover the
entire platoon in the broadcast process.</li>
<li>V2V communications process: Once the process of the
broadcast is completed, each M-PV will start transmitting its
own CAMs to the adjacent M-PV behind it, the corresponding communication links are denoted with the blue arrow
in Fig. 1. We apply Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD)
mechanism so that M-PVs can transmit and receive CAMs
using different RBs simultaneously. Meanwhile, different
M-PVs can share RBs within controllable interference. By
assuming that each M-PV occupies a dedicated RB, they can
reuse the RBs of all members when they are grouped into
one cluster. For example, three M-PVs in the same cluster
can reuse three RBs simultaneously.
B. Channel Models
It should be noted that the broadcast process and V2V
communications process have different time periods, as
shown in Fig. 1, we mainly focus on resource allocation
and interference management in V2V communications process. We assume that the inter-vehicle distance of different
platoons is same, which is denoted by d0.

In problem (6), the optimization variables are clustering
matrix XM×K×N and transmission power allocation matrix
PM×K. The total number of RBs used by all PVs is
M(K−2). Constraint (6b) indicates that the SINR of M-PVs
is no less than the minimum SINR requirement. Constraint
(6c) indicates that the transmission power of PVs should not
be larger than the maximum power. Constraint (6d) requires
that each M-PV can only be grouped into a cluster.
The optimization problem (6) is a maximum weighted
matching problem with nonlinear constraints, which is NPhard [13]. When there exist many PVs, exhaustive search
becomes unacceptable with high computational complexity.
Therefore, we propose a Hypergraph-based Resource Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) scheme to
solve the spectral efficiency maximization problem.
III. Hypergraph Based Resource Allocation
In this section, we will first give some preliminaries
about hypergraph theory and coloring algorithm, and then
construct a hypergraph for M-PVs. Finally, we introduce the
HRAIM scheme in detail.
A. Hypergraph Preliminaries
Here, we introduce several necessary definitions of hypergraph in the following [10].
Definition 1: A hypergraph H(X, E) is a vertex set X and
a set of edges E including hyperedges containing more than
two vertices and ordinary edges connecting two vertices.
Definition 2: In a hypergraph H(X, E), a strong deletion
of a vertex x ∈ X from H is to delete x from H and all the
edges containing x from E.
Definition 3: The monodegree of a vertex x is the maximum cardinality of a hyperedge subfamily E1(x) ⊆ E such
that two elements ei, ej ∈ E1(x), ei ∩ ej = x.
In Fig. 2, M-PVs constitute the vertex set, the interference
relationship among M-PVs constitutes ordinary edges set
and hyperedges set. Meanwhile, the set formed by edge 2
and edge 5 is the hyperedge subfamily of vertex x, and the
monodegree of x is 4.

edge 4 are ordinary edges. Edge 5 and edge 6 are hyperedges.
B. Interference Hypergraph Construction
We model M-PVs and the interference relationship among
several M-PVs as vertices and hyperedges, respectively. The
vertices in the same hyperedges represent that the cumulative
interference is so large that they cannot be grouped into
the same cluster. In other words, they cannot be colored
with the same color. As shown as Fig. 2, the M-PVs with
different circles represent that the M-PVs are in different
clusters. In the following, we establish the hypergraph with
the construction of ordinary edges and hyperedges.</li>
<li>Ordinary edges construction: For each vertex vji−1
reusing the same RB with another vehicle vls−1, if the SINR
of this vertex satisfies (7), then we connect two vertices with
an ordinary edge. As shown in Fig. 2, edge 1, edge 2, edge
3, and edge 4 are ordinary edges.

<li>Hyperedges construction: For each vertex vji−1
reusing the same RB with multiple vehicles, if the SINR
of this vertex satisfies (8), then we construct a hyperedge for
these vertices. As shown in Fig. 2, edge 5 and edge 6 are
hyperedges.

C. The Hypergraph-based Resource Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) Scheme for Multi-platoon
After constructing the hypergraph, we use hypergraph coloring algorithm to address the resource allocation problem.
In the coloring algorithm, the vertices in the same edge
should be colored by at least 2 colors. First, according
to the interference relationship among PVs, we establish
ordinary edges and hyperedges with (7) and (8) to construct a

hypergraph. Then, according to the constructed hypergraph,
we calculate the monodegree for each vertex, and label the
PV which has the minimum monodegree with fL, where L
is the total number of vertices. Next, we strongly delete this
vertex and then get a new hypergraph. Based on this new
hypergraph, we repeat these steps until all vertices are sorted
by their monodegree. Finally, we color these vertices according to F= {f1, f2&hellip;fL} in a color which is in the available
color set. Note that the available color set of a vertex contains
these colors not being used by all vertices in the same
edge. If the available color set is empty, this vertex remains
uncolored. We conclude the HRAIM scheme in Algorithm</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>In Algorithm 1, the computational complexity of step
1 and step 2 are O((MK)2) and O((MK)3), respectively.
From step 4 to step 9, we have a loop with MK iterations.
Since the computational complexity is O((MK)3) from step
4 to step 6, the total complexity from step 4 to step 9 is
O((MK)4). In summary, the computational complexity of
the proposed HRAIM scheme is O((MK)4).

After using Algorithm 1, we can obtain the clustering
results for M-PVs, i.e., the M-PVs with the same color is
a cluster. Referring to [14], we can prove that in problem
(6), the optimization objective function can be decomposed
into the sum of a convex function and a concave function.
Then we use the Interior Point Method to transform the
inequality constrained convex optimization problem into an
unconstrained problem. Finally, for each cluster, we use the
Concave-Convex Procedure to linearize the concave part so
that the non-convex problem can be solved as a convex
problem. Then we use Newton’s Method to optimize the
transmit powers in problem (6).
IV. Simulation Results and Analysis

graph-coloring algorithm as benchmarks to evaluate the

proposed HRAIM scheme in terms of sum data rate of
all M-PVs and spectral efficiency. In the simulations, we
assume that the number of PVs in each cluster is 3, and the
distance between platoons is 30 m. Besides, we set the SINR
threshold γmin = 4 dB, the pathloss exponent α = 3, and
the AWGN power σ2 = −30 dBm.
Fig. 3 illustrates the effects of the number of platoons
and the value of individual maximum transmission power
on sum data rate of all M-PVs. Generally, when the number
of platoons increases, the sum data rate of all M-PVs grows.
The reason is that as the number of platoons grows, although
M-PVs need to share RBs with other M-PVs, the M-PVs can
use more RBs at the same time, and thus M-PVs can still
achieve a higher sum data rate. Meanwhile, Fig. 4 presents
that with different value of individual maximum transmission
power, the changes of spectral efficiency of all M-PVs as the
platoons number increases. We can observe that when the
number of platoons increases, the spectral efficiency rises.
This reason is that when we have more platoons, the increase
in the sum data rate of all M-PVs is greater than the increase
in the number of RBs, which contributes to the growth of

spectral efficiency. Specifically, when the number of platoons
is small, the spectral efficiency and the sum data rate of
all M-PVs are the same for HRAIM scheme and traditional
graph-coloring algorithm. This phenomenon is because that
M-PVs have fewer candidate RBs reusing pairs when there
are fewer platoons.
Fig. 5 displays the effects of the inter-vehicle distance and
the value of individual maximum transmission power on sum
data rate of all M-PVs. Generally, given a fixed number of
M-PVs (i.e., RBs), when the inter-vehicle distance increases,
the sum data rate decreases since the inter-vehicle distance
reduces the desired signal power gains. From Fig. 6, we
can observe that the spectral efficiency decreases with the
growth of inter-vehicle distance, since the reduced sum data
rate results in a lower spectral efficiency when the number
of RBs is fixed. Besides, when the inter-vehicle distance
increases, the spectral efficiency and the sum data rate of all
M-PVs are nearly the same for both HRAIM scheme and
traditional graph-coloring algorithm, since the advantage of
cumulative interference management becomes smaller when
the interference influence among M-PVs gets less.
V. Conclusions
This paper studied the joint optimization problem of
spectrum sharing and interference management in multiplatoon scenario. We assumed that L-PVs used the dedicated
RBs when transmitting messages to BS and broadcasting
their CAMs to their M-PVs, respectively. Meanwhile, MPVs reused the RBs with each other to forward their CAMs
to the adjacent M-PVs behind them. To maximize the
spectral efficiency, we transformed the resource allocation
problem into a hypergraph coloring problem. We proposed
a HRAIM scheme to select M-PVs based on their predefined
minimum SINR thresholds. Numerical results illustrated the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of spectral
efficiency and sum data rate.

Abstract—Platoon communications in vehicular networks is
considered to have broad application prospects in improving
road capacity and traffic safety. This paper considers a multiplatoon vehicle scenario, in which platoon vehicles (PVs)
transmit cooperative awareness messages (CAMs) to other PVs
in the same platoon. The leader platoon vehicles (L-PVs)
use dedicated resource blocks (RBs) to communicate with the
base station (BS) and broadcast their CAMs to their member
platoon vehicles (M-PVs). Meanwhile, to increase spectral efficiency and satisfy the communication demands of PVs, we allow
M-PVs to reuse RBs with each other to transmit their CAMs.
Finally, due to the fact that traditional graph can only model
pairwise relations, we utilize hypergraph to model relationship
among several users and propose a Hypergraph-based Resource
Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) scheme
for multi-platoon scenario. Simulation results illustrate that
the proposed scheme shows a better performance in terms of
spectral efficiency and sum data rate when compared with
traditional graph coloring algorithm and random selection
scheme.

I. Introduction
In vehicle-to-everything communications, platoon is considered to be one of the most representative fifth-generation
(5G) use cases, which can enhance traffic efficiency [1].
To support the synchronous control of the platoon, all
platoon vehicles (PVs) should maintain the same speed and
a constant inter-vehicle distance to ensure string stability [2]
[3], which makes the spacing and velocity error of platoon
would not be amplified with the downstream of the platoon. Therefore, it is essential to transmit their cooperative
awareness messages (CAMs) to other PVs. CAMs include
messages about the driving strategy of the platoon such
as speed and acceleration, as well as information about
resource scheduling within the platoon [1]. According to

communication structure of PVs, there are three main control
strategies, i.e., predecessor following control (PFC) strategy,
symmetric bidirectional control (SBC) strategy, predecessorleader following control (PLFC) strategy [4] [5]. Among
them, the PLFC strategy is a major approach, which shows
outstanding performance in improving string stability [5].
Specifically, each member platoon vehicle (M-PV) communicates with the leader platoon vehicle (L-PV) and the
adjacent PV in front of it to ensure string stability.
When PVs transmit their CAMs, they need to occupy
a certain amount of spectrum resources to realize predefined communication quality, e.g., the minimum data rate
requirements. In face of limited spectrum resources, reusing
spectrum is a promising way to enhance spectral efficiency,
which however introduces more interference among vehicles.
In this case, allocating spectrum resources reasonably is critical to improve communication delay and network capacity.
The authors in [6] jointly considered the platoon size and
power consumption of the platoon, and designed a twostep resource allocation strategy based on branch and bound
algorithm. Works in [7] proposed a time division-based
intra-platoon and minimum rate guaranteed inter-platoon
resource allocation mechanisms to allocate resources for
D2D users efficiently within the platoon. However, the joint
optimization problem of resource allocation and interference
management for multi-platoon scenario has not been well
studied.
The traditional graph can tackle the interference problem,
and the ordinary edges can model pairwise relations, which
however is not sufficient in modeling cumulative interference
in wireless networks. Hypergraph is a useful tool to tackle
this challenge, and it has been applied widely in recent
years [8] [9], since the hyperedges in hypergraph can take
into account the cumulative interference from several users.
Specifically, hypergraph coloring algorithm is an approximate and efficient method for resource allocation problem,
in which users can be modeled as vertices, and the interference relationship among multi-users can be constructed
as hyperedges, RBs can be constructed as different colors
[8] [10]. The authors in [11] used a weighted three-partite
interference hypergraph (IHG) to imitate the complex interference and put forward an IHG-based three-dimensional
matching resource allocation protocol. Meanwhile, works
in [12] proposed a hypergraph spectral clustering based

method in non-orthogonal multiple access heterogeneous
network to deal with the serious cumulative interference.
However, at the time of writing, there is no work invoking
the hypergraph coloring algorithm to address the resource
allocation problem in multi-platoon scenario.
Motivated by above discussions, this paper focuses on
resource allocation and interference management in multiplatoon scenario based on hypergraph coloring algorithm.
Main contributions are summarized as follows. Firstly, we
consider a multi-platoon scenario and formulate an optimization problem to maximize the spectral efficiency of
all M-PVs in the scenario. Then we propose a resource
allocation and interference management scheme for multiplatoon based on hypergraph coloring algorithm to solve the
problem. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the
proposed scheme in terms of spectral efficiency and sum
date rate.
II. System Model And Problem Formulation
In this section, we first describe the multi-platoon scenario along with the channel model. Then, we formulate a
general resource allocation problem to maximize the spectral
efficiency for the whole network.
A. System Model
We consider a multi-platoon scenario consisting of M
platoons on a fixed road segment, as shown in Fig. 1. The
i-th platoon is denoted by Vi. The number of PVs in each
platoon is the same, which is denoted by K, and the PVs
in Vi are denoted by Vi = {v1i, v2i, &hellip;, vji, &hellip;, vKi i}. Among
them, v1i is the L-PV and vji is the j-th PV of platoon Vi.
The licensed spectrum is divided into multiple RBs with
unit bandwidth, which can be reused by M-PVs. The MPVs reusing the same RBs are grouped into a cluster, and
the clusters are denoted by R= {r1, r2, &hellip;, rN}. Without
loss of generality, we apply the PLFC strategy in this work,
and give detailed discussions on its two main transmission
processes.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Broadcast process: Firstly, the L-PVs not only need
to receive the information from the BS, such as resource
scheduling messages, but also need to transmit their CAMs
to BS. The corresponding communication links are denoted
with red and orange dotted arrows in Fig. 1. Then L-PVs
broadcast their CAMs to their M-PVs. Due to the broadcast
range is limited, the L-PVs might not be able to cover the
entire platoon in the broadcast process.</li>
<li>V2V communications process: Once the process of the
broadcast is completed, each M-PV will start transmitting its
own CAMs to the adjacent M-PV behind it, the corresponding communication links are denoted with the blue arrow
in Fig. 1. We apply Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD)
mechanism so that M-PVs can transmit and receive CAMs
using different RBs simultaneously. Meanwhile, different
M-PVs can share RBs within controllable interference. By
assuming that each M-PV occupies a dedicated RB, they can
reuse the RBs of all members when they are grouped into
one cluster. For example, three M-PVs in the same cluster
can reuse three RBs simultaneously.
B. Channel Models
It should be noted that the broadcast process and V2V
communications process have different time periods, as
shown in Fig. 1, we mainly focus on resource allocation
and interference management in V2V communications process. We assume that the inter-vehicle distance of different
platoons is same, which is denoted by d0.

In problem (6), the optimization variables are clustering
matrix XM×K×N and transmission power allocation matrix
PM×K. The total number of RBs used by all PVs is
M(K−2). Constraint (6b) indicates that the SINR of M-PVs
is no less than the minimum SINR requirement. Constraint
(6c) indicates that the transmission power of PVs should not
be larger than the maximum power. Constraint (6d) requires
that each M-PV can only be grouped into a cluster.
The optimization problem (6) is a maximum weighted
matching problem with nonlinear constraints, which is NPhard [13]. When there exist many PVs, exhaustive search
becomes unacceptable with high computational complexity.
Therefore, we propose a Hypergraph-based Resource Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) scheme to
solve the spectral efficiency maximization problem.
III. Hypergraph Based Resource Allocation
In this section, we will first give some preliminaries
about hypergraph theory and coloring algorithm, and then
construct a hypergraph for M-PVs. Finally, we introduce the
HRAIM scheme in detail.
A. Hypergraph Preliminaries
Here, we introduce several necessary definitions of hypergraph in the following [10].
Definition 1: A hypergraph H(X, E) is a vertex set X and
a set of edges E including hyperedges containing more than
two vertices and ordinary edges connecting two vertices.
Definition 2: In a hypergraph H(X, E), a strong deletion
of a vertex x ∈ X from H is to delete x from H and all the
edges containing x from E.
Definition 3: The monodegree of a vertex x is the maximum cardinality of a hyperedge subfamily E1(x) ⊆ E such
that two elements ei, ej ∈ E1(x), ei ∩ ej = x.
In Fig. 2, M-PVs constitute the vertex set, the interference
relationship among M-PVs constitutes ordinary edges set
and hyperedges set. Meanwhile, the set formed by edge 2
and edge 5 is the hyperedge subfamily of vertex x, and the
monodegree of x is 4.

edge 4 are ordinary edges. Edge 5 and edge 6 are hyperedges.
B. Interference Hypergraph Construction
We model M-PVs and the interference relationship among
several M-PVs as vertices and hyperedges, respectively. The
vertices in the same hyperedges represent that the cumulative
interference is so large that they cannot be grouped into
the same cluster. In other words, they cannot be colored
with the same color. As shown as Fig. 2, the M-PVs with
different circles represent that the M-PVs are in different
clusters. In the following, we establish the hypergraph with
the construction of ordinary edges and hyperedges.</li>
<li>Ordinary edges construction: For each vertex vji−1
reusing the same RB with another vehicle vls−1, if the SINR
of this vertex satisfies (7), then we connect two vertices with
an ordinary edge. As shown in Fig. 2, edge 1, edge 2, edge
3, and edge 4 are ordinary edges.

of this vertex satisfies (8), then we construct a hyperedge for
these vertices. As shown in Fig. 2, edge 5 and edge 6 are
hyperedges.

C. The Hypergraph-based Resource Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) Scheme for Multi-platoon
After constructing the hypergraph, we use hypergraph coloring algorithm to address the resource allocation problem.
In the coloring algorithm, the vertices in the same edge
should be colored by at least 2 colors. First, according
to the interference relationship among PVs, we establish
ordinary edges and hyperedges with (7) and (8) to construct a

hypergraph. Then, according to the constructed hypergraph,
we calculate the monodegree for each vertex, and label the
PV which has the minimum monodegree with fL, where L
is the total number of vertices. Next, we strongly delete this
vertex and then get a new hypergraph. Based on this new
hypergraph, we repeat these steps until all vertices are sorted
by their monodegree. Finally, we color these vertices according to F= {f1, f2&hellip;fL} in a color which is in the available
color set. Note that the available color set of a vertex contains
these colors not being used by all vertices in the same
edge. If the available color set is empty, this vertex remains
uncolored. We conclude the HRAIM scheme in Algorithm</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>In Algorithm 1, the computational complexity of step
1 and step 2 are O((MK)2) and O((MK)3), respectively.
From step 4 to step 9, we have a loop with MK iterations.
Since the computational complexity is O((MK)3) from step
4 to step 6, the total complexity from step 4 to step 9 is
O((MK)4). In summary, the computational complexity of
the proposed HRAIM scheme is O((MK)4).

After using Algorithm 1, we can obtain the clustering
results for M-PVs, i.e., the M-PVs with the same color is
a cluster. Referring to [14], we can prove that in problem
(6), the optimization objective function can be decomposed
into the sum of a convex function and a concave function.
Then we use the Interior Point Method to transform the
inequality constrained convex optimization problem into an
unconstrained problem. Finally, for each cluster, we use the
Concave-Convex Procedure to linearize the concave part so
that the non-convex problem can be solved as a convex
problem. Then we use Newton’s Method to optimize the
transmit powers in problem (6).
IV. Simulation Results and Analysis

proposed HRAIM scheme in terms of sum data rate of
all M-PVs and spectral efficiency. In the simulations, we
assume that the number of PVs in each cluster is 3, and the
distance between platoons is 30 m. Besides, we set the SINR
threshold γmin = 4 dB, the pathloss exponent α = 3, and
the AWGN power σ2 = −30 dBm.
Fig. 3 illustrates the effects of the number of platoons
and the value of individual maximum transmission power
on sum data rate of all M-PVs. Generally, when the number
of platoons increases, the sum data rate of all M-PVs grows.
The reason is that as the number of platoons grows, although
M-PVs need to share RBs with other M-PVs, the M-PVs can
use more RBs at the same time, and thus M-PVs can still
achieve a higher sum data rate. Meanwhile, Fig. 4 presents
that with different value of individual maximum transmission
power, the changes of spectral efficiency of all M-PVs as the
platoons number increases. We can observe that when the
number of platoons increases, the spectral efficiency rises.
This reason is that when we have more platoons, the increase
in the sum data rate of all M-PVs is greater than the increase
in the number of RBs, which contributes to the growth of

spectral efficiency. Specifically, when the number of platoons
is small, the spectral efficiency and the sum data rate of
all M-PVs are the same for HRAIM scheme and traditional
graph-coloring algorithm. This phenomenon is because that
M-PVs have fewer candidate RBs reusing pairs when there
are fewer platoons.
Fig. 5 displays the effects of the inter-vehicle distance and
the value of individual maximum transmission power on sum
data rate of all M-PVs. Generally, given a fixed number of
M-PVs (i.e., RBs), when the inter-vehicle distance increases,
the sum data rate decreases since the inter-vehicle distance
reduces the desired signal power gains. From Fig. 6, we
can observe that the spectral efficiency decreases with the
growth of inter-vehicle distance, since the reduced sum data
rate results in a lower spectral efficiency when the number
of RBs is fixed. Besides, when the inter-vehicle distance
increases, the spectral efficiency and the sum data rate of all
M-PVs are nearly the same for both HRAIM scheme and
traditional graph-coloring algorithm, since the advantage of
cumulative interference management becomes smaller when
the interference influence among M-PVs gets less.
V. Conclusions
This paper studied the joint optimization problem of
spectrum sharing and interference management in multiplatoon scenario. We assumed that L-PVs used the dedicated
RBs when transmitting messages to BS and broadcasting
their CAMs to their M-PVs, respectively. Meanwhile, MPVs reused the RBs with each other to forward their CAMs
to the adjacent M-PVs behind them. To maximize the
spectral efficiency, we transformed the resource allocation
problem into a hypergraph coloring problem. We proposed
a HRAIM scheme to select M-PVs based on their predefined
minimum SINR thresholds. Numerical results illustrated the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of spectral
efficiency and sum data rate.

Abstract—Platoon communications in vehicular networks is
considered to have broad application prospects in improving
road capacity and traffic safety. This paper considers a multiplatoon vehicle scenario, in which platoon vehicles (PVs)
transmit cooperative awareness messages (CAMs) to other PVs
in the same platoon. The leader platoon vehicles (L-PVs)
use dedicated resource blocks (RBs) to communicate with the
base station (BS) and broadcast their CAMs to their member
platoon vehicles (M-PVs). Meanwhile, to increase spectral efficiency and satisfy the communication demands of PVs, we allow
M-PVs to reuse RBs with each other to transmit their CAMs.
Finally, due to the fact that traditional graph can only model
pairwise relations, we utilize hypergraph to model relationship
among several users and propose a Hypergraph-based Resource
Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) scheme
for multi-platoon scenario. Simulation results illustrate that
the proposed scheme shows a better performance in terms of
spectral efficiency and sum data rate when compared with
traditional graph coloring algorithm and random selection
scheme.

I. Introduction
In vehicle-to-everything communications, platoon is considered to be one of the most representative fifth-generation
(5G) use cases, which can enhance traffic efficiency [1].
To support the synchronous control of the platoon, all
platoon vehicles (PVs) should maintain the same speed and
a constant inter-vehicle distance to ensure string stability [2]
[3], which makes the spacing and velocity error of platoon
would not be amplified with the downstream of the platoon. Therefore, it is essential to transmit their cooperative
awareness messages (CAMs) to other PVs. CAMs include
messages about the driving strategy of the platoon such
as speed and acceleration, as well as information about
resource scheduling within the platoon [1]. According to

communication structure of PVs, there are three main control
strategies, i.e., predecessor following control (PFC) strategy,
symmetric bidirectional control (SBC) strategy, predecessorleader following control (PLFC) strategy [4] [5]. Among
them, the PLFC strategy is a major approach, which shows
outstanding performance in improving string stability [5].
Specifically, each member platoon vehicle (M-PV) communicates with the leader platoon vehicle (L-PV) and the
adjacent PV in front of it to ensure string stability.
When PVs transmit their CAMs, they need to occupy
a certain amount of spectrum resources to realize predefined communication quality, e.g., the minimum data rate
requirements. In face of limited spectrum resources, reusing
spectrum is a promising way to enhance spectral efficiency,
which however introduces more interference among vehicles.
In this case, allocating spectrum resources reasonably is critical to improve communication delay and network capacity.
The authors in [6] jointly considered the platoon size and
power consumption of the platoon, and designed a twostep resource allocation strategy based on branch and bound
algorithm. Works in [7] proposed a time division-based
intra-platoon and minimum rate guaranteed inter-platoon
resource allocation mechanisms to allocate resources for
D2D users efficiently within the platoon. However, the joint
optimization problem of resource allocation and interference
management for multi-platoon scenario has not been well
studied.
The traditional graph can tackle the interference problem,
and the ordinary edges can model pairwise relations, which
however is not sufficient in modeling cumulative interference
in wireless networks. Hypergraph is a useful tool to tackle
this challenge, and it has been applied widely in recent
years [8] [9], since the hyperedges in hypergraph can take
into account the cumulative interference from several users.
Specifically, hypergraph coloring algorithm is an approximate and efficient method for resource allocation problem,
in which users can be modeled as vertices, and the interference relationship among multi-users can be constructed
as hyperedges, RBs can be constructed as different colors
[8] [10]. The authors in [11] used a weighted three-partite
interference hypergraph (IHG) to imitate the complex interference and put forward an IHG-based three-dimensional
matching resource allocation protocol. Meanwhile, works
in [12] proposed a hypergraph spectral clustering based

method in non-orthogonal multiple access heterogeneous
network to deal with the serious cumulative interference.
However, at the time of writing, there is no work invoking
the hypergraph coloring algorithm to address the resource
allocation problem in multi-platoon scenario.
Motivated by above discussions, this paper focuses on
resource allocation and interference management in multiplatoon scenario based on hypergraph coloring algorithm.
Main contributions are summarized as follows. Firstly, we
consider a multi-platoon scenario and formulate an optimization problem to maximize the spectral efficiency of
all M-PVs in the scenario. Then we propose a resource
allocation and interference management scheme for multiplatoon based on hypergraph coloring algorithm to solve the
problem. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the
proposed scheme in terms of spectral efficiency and sum
date rate.
II. System Model And Problem Formulation
In this section, we first describe the multi-platoon scenario along with the channel model. Then, we formulate a
general resource allocation problem to maximize the spectral
efficiency for the whole network.
A. System Model
We consider a multi-platoon scenario consisting of M
platoons on a fixed road segment, as shown in Fig. 1. The
i-th platoon is denoted by Vi. The number of PVs in each
platoon is the same, which is denoted by K, and the PVs
in Vi are denoted by Vi = {v1i, v2i, &hellip;, vji, &hellip;, vKi i}. Among
them, v1i is the L-PV and vji is the j-th PV of platoon Vi.
The licensed spectrum is divided into multiple RBs with
unit bandwidth, which can be reused by M-PVs. The MPVs reusing the same RBs are grouped into a cluster, and
the clusters are denoted by R= {r1, r2, &hellip;, rN}. Without
loss of generality, we apply the PLFC strategy in this work,
and give detailed discussions on its two main transmission
processes.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Broadcast process: Firstly, the L-PVs not only need
to receive the information from the BS, such as resource
scheduling messages, but also need to transmit their CAMs
to BS. The corresponding communication links are denoted
with red and orange dotted arrows in Fig. 1. Then L-PVs
broadcast their CAMs to their M-PVs. Due to the broadcast
range is limited, the L-PVs might not be able to cover the
entire platoon in the broadcast process.</li>
<li>V2V communications process: Once the process of the
broadcast is completed, each M-PV will start transmitting its
own CAMs to the adjacent M-PV behind it, the corresponding communication links are denoted with the blue arrow
in Fig. 1. We apply Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD)
mechanism so that M-PVs can transmit and receive CAMs
using different RBs simultaneously. Meanwhile, different
M-PVs can share RBs within controllable interference. By
assuming that each M-PV occupies a dedicated RB, they can
reuse the RBs of all members when they are grouped into
one cluster. For example, three M-PVs in the same cluster
can reuse three RBs simultaneously.
B. Channel Models
It should be noted that the broadcast process and V2V
communications process have different time periods, as
shown in Fig. 1, we mainly focus on resource allocation
and interference management in V2V communications process. We assume that the inter-vehicle distance of different
platoons is same, which is denoted by d0.

To maximize the spectral efficiency of all platoons with
the joint optimization of user clustering and resource allocation, we formulate the optimization problem as

In problem (6), the optimization variables are clustering
matrix XM×K×N and transmission power allocation matrix
PM×K. The total number of RBs used by all PVs is
M(K−2). Constraint (6b) indicates that the SINR of M-PVs
is no less than the minimum SINR requirement. Constraint
(6c) indicates that the transmission power of PVs should not
be larger than the maximum power. Constraint (6d) requires
that each M-PV can only be grouped into a cluster.
The optimization problem (6) is a maximum weighted
matching problem with nonlinear constraints, which is NPhard [13]. When there exist many PVs, exhaustive search
becomes unacceptable with high computational complexity.
Therefore, we propose a Hypergraph-based Resource Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) scheme to
solve the spectral efficiency maximization problem.
III. Hypergraph Based Resource Allocation
In this section, we will first give some preliminaries
about hypergraph theory and coloring algorithm, and then
construct a hypergraph for M-PVs. Finally, we introduce the
HRAIM scheme in detail.
A. Hypergraph Preliminaries
Here, we introduce several necessary definitions of hypergraph in the following [10].
Definition 1: A hypergraph H(X, E) is a vertex set X and
a set of edges E including hyperedges containing more than
two vertices and ordinary edges connecting two vertices.
Definition 2: In a hypergraph H(X, E), a strong deletion
of a vertex x ∈ X from H is to delete x from H and all the
edges containing x from E.
Definition 3: The monodegree of a vertex x is the maximum cardinality of a hyperedge subfamily E1(x) ⊆ E such
that two elements ei, ej ∈ E1(x), ei ∩ ej = x.
In Fig. 2, M-PVs constitute the vertex set, the interference
relationship among M-PVs constitutes ordinary edges set
and hyperedges set. Meanwhile, the set formed by edge 2
and edge 5 is the hyperedge subfamily of vertex x, and the
monodegree of x is 4.

edge 4 are ordinary edges. Edge 5 and edge 6 are hyperedges.
B. Interference Hypergraph Construction
We model M-PVs and the interference relationship among
several M-PVs as vertices and hyperedges, respectively. The
vertices in the same hyperedges represent that the cumulative
interference is so large that they cannot be grouped into
the same cluster. In other words, they cannot be colored
with the same color. As shown as Fig. 2, the M-PVs with
different circles represent that the M-PVs are in different
clusters. In the following, we establish the hypergraph with
the construction of ordinary edges and hyperedges.</li>
<li>Ordinary edges construction: For each vertex vji−1
reusing the same RB with another vehicle vls−1, if the SINR
of this vertex satisfies (7), then we connect two vertices with
an ordinary edge. As shown in Fig. 2, edge 1, edge 2, edge
3, and edge 4 are ordinary edges.

where 1 ≤ i, s ≤ M, 1 ≤ n ≤ N, 2 ≤ j, l ≤ K − 1.</li>
<li>Hyperedges construction: For each vertex vji−1
reusing the same RB with multiple vehicles, if the SINR
of this vertex satisfies (8), then we construct a hyperedge for
these vertices. As shown in Fig. 2, edge 5 and edge 6 are
hyperedges.

C. The Hypergraph-based Resource Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) Scheme for Multi-platoon
After constructing the hypergraph, we use hypergraph coloring algorithm to address the resource allocation problem.
In the coloring algorithm, the vertices in the same edge
should be colored by at least 2 colors. First, according
to the interference relationship among PVs, we establish
ordinary edges and hyperedges with (7) and (8) to construct a

hypergraph. Then, according to the constructed hypergraph,
we calculate the monodegree for each vertex, and label the
PV which has the minimum monodegree with fL, where L
is the total number of vertices. Next, we strongly delete this
vertex and then get a new hypergraph. Based on this new
hypergraph, we repeat these steps until all vertices are sorted
by their monodegree. Finally, we color these vertices according to F= {f1, f2&hellip;fL} in a color which is in the available
color set. Note that the available color set of a vertex contains
these colors not being used by all vertices in the same
edge. If the available color set is empty, this vertex remains
uncolored. We conclude the HRAIM scheme in Algorithm</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>In Algorithm 1, the computational complexity of step
1 and step 2 are O((MK)2) and O((MK)3), respectively.
From step 4 to step 9, we have a loop with MK iterations.
Since the computational complexity is O((MK)3) from step
4 to step 6, the total complexity from step 4 to step 9 is
O((MK)4). In summary, the computational complexity of
the proposed HRAIM scheme is O((MK)4).

γmin: the SINR threshold for M-PVs;
L: the number of M-PVs.

Until: All vertices are sorted by monodegrees.
10: According to the user order of label set F= {f1, f2&hellip;fL},
color the vertices in a color selected from the available
color set.
After using Algorithm 1, we can obtain the clustering
results for M-PVs, i.e., the M-PVs with the same color is
a cluster. Referring to [14], we can prove that in problem
(6), the optimization objective function can be decomposed
into the sum of a convex function and a concave function.
Then we use the Interior Point Method to transform the
inequality constrained convex optimization problem into an
unconstrained problem. Finally, for each cluster, we use the
Concave-Convex Procedure to linearize the concave part so
that the non-convex problem can be solved as a convex
problem. Then we use Newton’s Method to optimize the
transmit powers in problem (6).
IV. Simulation Results and Analysis

graph-coloring algorithm as benchmarks to evaluate the

proposed HRAIM scheme in terms of sum data rate of
all M-PVs and spectral efficiency. In the simulations, we
assume that the number of PVs in each cluster is 3, and the
distance between platoons is 30 m. Besides, we set the SINR
threshold γmin = 4 dB, the pathloss exponent α = 3, and
the AWGN power σ2 = −30 dBm.
Fig. 3 illustrates the effects of the number of platoons
and the value of individual maximum transmission power
on sum data rate of all M-PVs. Generally, when the number
of platoons increases, the sum data rate of all M-PVs grows.
The reason is that as the number of platoons grows, although
M-PVs need to share RBs with other M-PVs, the M-PVs can
use more RBs at the same time, and thus M-PVs can still
achieve a higher sum data rate. Meanwhile, Fig. 4 presents
that with different value of individual maximum transmission
power, the changes of spectral efficiency of all M-PVs as the
platoons number increases. We can observe that when the
number of platoons increases, the spectral efficiency rises.
This reason is that when we have more platoons, the increase
in the sum data rate of all M-PVs is greater than the increase
in the number of RBs, which contributes to the growth of

spectral efficiency. Specifically, when the number of platoons
is small, the spectral efficiency and the sum data rate of
all M-PVs are the same for HRAIM scheme and traditional
graph-coloring algorithm. This phenomenon is because that
M-PVs have fewer candidate RBs reusing pairs when there
are fewer platoons.
Fig. 5 displays the effects of the inter-vehicle distance and
the value of individual maximum transmission power on sum
data rate of all M-PVs. Generally, given a fixed number of
M-PVs (i.e., RBs), when the inter-vehicle distance increases,
the sum data rate decreases since the inter-vehicle distance
reduces the desired signal power gains. From Fig. 6, we
can observe that the spectral efficiency decreases with the
growth of inter-vehicle distance, since the reduced sum data
rate results in a lower spectral efficiency when the number
of RBs is fixed. Besides, when the inter-vehicle distance
increases, the spectral efficiency and the sum data rate of all
M-PVs are nearly the same for both HRAIM scheme and
traditional graph-coloring algorithm, since the advantage of
cumulative interference management becomes smaller when
the interference influence among M-PVs gets less.
V. Conclusions
This paper studied the joint optimization problem of
spectrum sharing and interference management in multiplatoon scenario. We assumed that L-PVs used the dedicated
RBs when transmitting messages to BS and broadcasting
their CAMs to their M-PVs, respectively. Meanwhile, MPVs reused the RBs with each other to forward their CAMs
to the adjacent M-PVs behind them. To maximize the
spectral efficiency, we transformed the resource allocation
problem into a hypergraph coloring problem. We proposed
a HRAIM scheme to select M-PVs based on their predefined
minimum SINR thresholds. Numerical results illustrated the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of spectral
efficiency and sum data rate.

Abstract—Platoon communications in vehicular networks is
considered to have broad application prospects in improving
road capacity and traffic safety. This paper considers a multiplatoon vehicle scenario, in which platoon vehicles (PVs)
transmit cooperative awareness messages (CAMs) to other PVs
in the same platoon. The leader platoon vehicles (L-PVs)
use dedicated resource blocks (RBs) to communicate with the
base station (BS) and broadcast their CAMs to their member
platoon vehicles (M-PVs). Meanwhile, to increase spectral efficiency and satisfy the communication demands of PVs, we allow
M-PVs to reuse RBs with each other to transmit their CAMs.
Finally, due to the fact that traditional graph can only model
pairwise relations, we utilize hypergraph to model relationship
among several users and propose a Hypergraph-based Resource
Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) scheme
for multi-platoon scenario. Simulation results illustrate that
the proposed scheme shows a better performance in terms of
spectral efficiency and sum data rate when compared with
traditional graph coloring algorithm and random selection
scheme.

I. Introduction
In vehicle-to-everything communications, platoon is considered to be one of the most representative fifth-generation
(5G) use cases, which can enhance traffic efficiency [1].
To support the synchronous control of the platoon, all
platoon vehicles (PVs) should maintain the same speed and
a constant inter-vehicle distance to ensure string stability [2]
[3], which makes the spacing and velocity error of platoon
would not be amplified with the downstream of the platoon. Therefore, it is essential to transmit their cooperative
awareness messages (CAMs) to other PVs. CAMs include
messages about the driving strategy of the platoon such
as speed and acceleration, as well as information about
resource scheduling within the platoon [1]. According to

communication structure of PVs, there are three main control
strategies, i.e., predecessor following control (PFC) strategy,
symmetric bidirectional control (SBC) strategy, predecessorleader following control (PLFC) strategy [4] [5]. Among
them, the PLFC strategy is a major approach, which shows
outstanding performance in improving string stability [5].
Specifically, each member platoon vehicle (M-PV) communicates with the leader platoon vehicle (L-PV) and the
adjacent PV in front of it to ensure string stability.
When PVs transmit their CAMs, they need to occupy
a certain amount of spectrum resources to realize predefined communication quality, e.g., the minimum data rate
requirements. In face of limited spectrum resources, reusing
spectrum is a promising way to enhance spectral efficiency,
which however introduces more interference among vehicles.
In this case, allocating spectrum resources reasonably is critical to improve communication delay and network capacity.
The authors in [6] jointly considered the platoon size and
power consumption of the platoon, and designed a twostep resource allocation strategy based on branch and bound
algorithm. Works in [7] proposed a time division-based
intra-platoon and minimum rate guaranteed inter-platoon
resource allocation mechanisms to allocate resources for
D2D users efficiently within the platoon. However, the joint
optimization problem of resource allocation and interference
management for multi-platoon scenario has not been well
studied.
The traditional graph can tackle the interference problem,
and the ordinary edges can model pairwise relations, which
however is not sufficient in modeling cumulative interference
in wireless networks. Hypergraph is a useful tool to tackle
this challenge, and it has been applied widely in recent
years [8] [9], since the hyperedges in hypergraph can take
into account the cumulative interference from several users.
Specifically, hypergraph coloring algorithm is an approximate and efficient method for resource allocation problem,
in which users can be modeled as vertices, and the interference relationship among multi-users can be constructed
as hyperedges, RBs can be constructed as different colors
[8] [10]. The authors in [11] used a weighted three-partite
interference hypergraph (IHG) to imitate the complex interference and put forward an IHG-based three-dimensional
matching resource allocation protocol. Meanwhile, works
in [12] proposed a hypergraph spectral clustering based

method in non-orthogonal multiple access heterogeneous
network to deal with the serious cumulative interference.
However, at the time of writing, there is no work invoking
the hypergraph coloring algorithm to address the resource
allocation problem in multi-platoon scenario.
Motivated by above discussions, this paper focuses on
resource allocation and interference management in multiplatoon scenario based on hypergraph coloring algorithm.
Main contributions are summarized as follows. Firstly, we
consider a multi-platoon scenario and formulate an optimization problem to maximize the spectral efficiency of
all M-PVs in the scenario. Then we propose a resource
allocation and interference management scheme for multiplatoon based on hypergraph coloring algorithm to solve the
problem. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the
proposed scheme in terms of spectral efficiency and sum
date rate.
II. System Model And Problem Formulation
In this section, we first describe the multi-platoon scenario along with the channel model. Then, we formulate a
general resource allocation problem to maximize the spectral
efficiency for the whole network.
A. System Model
We consider a multi-platoon scenario consisting of M
platoons on a fixed road segment, as shown in Fig. 1. The
i-th platoon is denoted by Vi. The number of PVs in each
platoon is the same, which is denoted by K, and the PVs
in Vi are denoted by Vi = {v1i, v2i, &hellip;, vji, &hellip;, vKi i}. Among
them, v1i is the L-PV and vji is the j-th PV of platoon Vi.
The licensed spectrum is divided into multiple RBs with
unit bandwidth, which can be reused by M-PVs. The MPVs reusing the same RBs are grouped into a cluster, and
the clusters are denoted by R= {r1, r2, &hellip;, rN}. Without
loss of generality, we apply the PLFC strategy in this work,
and give detailed discussions on its two main transmission
processes.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Broadcast process: Firstly, the L-PVs not only need
to receive the information from the BS, such as resource
scheduling messages, but also need to transmit their CAMs
to BS. The corresponding communication links are denoted
with red and orange dotted arrows in Fig. 1. Then L-PVs
broadcast their CAMs to their M-PVs. Due to the broadcast
range is limited, the L-PVs might not be able to cover the
entire platoon in the broadcast process.</li>
<li>V2V communications process: Once the process of the
broadcast is completed, each M-PV will start transmitting its
own CAMs to the adjacent M-PV behind it, the corresponding communication links are denoted with the blue arrow
in Fig. 1. We apply Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD)
mechanism so that M-PVs can transmit and receive CAMs
using different RBs simultaneously. Meanwhile, different
M-PVs can share RBs within controllable interference. By
assuming that each M-PV occupies a dedicated RB, they can
reuse the RBs of all members when they are grouped into
one cluster. For example, three M-PVs in the same cluster
can reuse three RBs simultaneously.
B. Channel Models
It should be noted that the broadcast process and V2V
communications process have different time periods, as
shown in Fig. 1, we mainly focus on resource allocation
and interference management in V2V communications process. We assume that the inter-vehicle distance of different
platoons is same, which is denoted by d0.

C. Problem Formulation
To maximize the spectral efficiency of all platoons with
the joint optimization of user clustering and resource allocation, we formulate the optimization problem as

In problem (6), the optimization variables are clustering
matrix XM×K×N and transmission power allocation matrix
PM×K. The total number of RBs used by all PVs is
M(K−2). Constraint (6b) indicates that the SINR of M-PVs
is no less than the minimum SINR requirement. Constraint
(6c) indicates that the transmission power of PVs should not
be larger than the maximum power. Constraint (6d) requires
that each M-PV can only be grouped into a cluster.
The optimization problem (6) is a maximum weighted
matching problem with nonlinear constraints, which is NPhard [13]. When there exist many PVs, exhaustive search
becomes unacceptable with high computational complexity.
Therefore, we propose a Hypergraph-based Resource Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) scheme to
solve the spectral efficiency maximization problem.
III. Hypergraph Based Resource Allocation
In this section, we will first give some preliminaries
about hypergraph theory and coloring algorithm, and then
construct a hypergraph for M-PVs. Finally, we introduce the
HRAIM scheme in detail.
A. Hypergraph Preliminaries
Here, we introduce several necessary definitions of hypergraph in the following [10].
Definition 1: A hypergraph H(X, E) is a vertex set X and
a set of edges E including hyperedges containing more than
two vertices and ordinary edges connecting two vertices.
Definition 2: In a hypergraph H(X, E), a strong deletion
of a vertex x ∈ X from H is to delete x from H and all the
edges containing x from E.
Definition 3: The monodegree of a vertex x is the maximum cardinality of a hyperedge subfamily E1(x) ⊆ E such
that two elements ei, ej ∈ E1(x), ei ∩ ej = x.
In Fig. 2, M-PVs constitute the vertex set, the interference
relationship among M-PVs constitutes ordinary edges set
and hyperedges set. Meanwhile, the set formed by edge 2
and edge 5 is the hyperedge subfamily of vertex x, and the
monodegree of x is 4.

edge 4 are ordinary edges. Edge 5 and edge 6 are hyperedges.
B. Interference Hypergraph Construction
We model M-PVs and the interference relationship among
several M-PVs as vertices and hyperedges, respectively. The
vertices in the same hyperedges represent that the cumulative
interference is so large that they cannot be grouped into
the same cluster. In other words, they cannot be colored
with the same color. As shown as Fig. 2, the M-PVs with
different circles represent that the M-PVs are in different
clusters. In the following, we establish the hypergraph with
the construction of ordinary edges and hyperedges.</li>
<li>Ordinary edges construction: For each vertex vji−1
reusing the same RB with another vehicle vls−1, if the SINR
of this vertex satisfies (7), then we connect two vertices with
an ordinary edge. As shown in Fig. 2, edge 1, edge 2, edge
3, and edge 4 are ordinary edges.

<li>Hyperedges construction: For each vertex vji−1
reusing the same RB with multiple vehicles, if the SINR
of this vertex satisfies (8), then we construct a hyperedge for
these vertices. As shown in Fig. 2, edge 5 and edge 6 are
hyperedges.

C. The Hypergraph-based Resource Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) Scheme for Multi-platoon
After constructing the hypergraph, we use hypergraph coloring algorithm to address the resource allocation problem.
In the coloring algorithm, the vertices in the same edge
should be colored by at least 2 colors. First, according
to the interference relationship among PVs, we establish
ordinary edges and hyperedges with (7) and (8) to construct a

hypergraph. Then, according to the constructed hypergraph,
we calculate the monodegree for each vertex, and label the
PV which has the minimum monodegree with fL, where L
is the total number of vertices. Next, we strongly delete this
vertex and then get a new hypergraph. Based on this new
hypergraph, we repeat these steps until all vertices are sorted
by their monodegree. Finally, we color these vertices according to F= {f1, f2&hellip;fL} in a color which is in the available
color set. Note that the available color set of a vertex contains
these colors not being used by all vertices in the same
edge. If the available color set is empty, this vertex remains
uncolored. We conclude the HRAIM scheme in Algorithm</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>In Algorithm 1, the computational complexity of step
1 and step 2 are O((MK)2) and O((MK)3), respectively.
From step 4 to step 9, we have a loop with MK iterations.
Since the computational complexity is O((MK)3) from step
4 to step 6, the total complexity from step 4 to step 9 is
O((MK)4). In summary, the computational complexity of
the proposed HRAIM scheme is O((MK)4).

γmin: the SINR threshold for M-PVs;

Until: All vertices are sorted by monodegrees.
10: According to the user order of label set F= {f1, f2&hellip;fL},
color the vertices in a color selected from the available
color set.
After using Algorithm 1, we can obtain the clustering
results for M-PVs, i.e., the M-PVs with the same color is
a cluster. Referring to [14], we can prove that in problem
(6), the optimization objective function can be decomposed
into the sum of a convex function and a concave function.
Then we use the Interior Point Method to transform the
inequality constrained convex optimization problem into an
unconstrained problem. Finally, for each cluster, we use the
Concave-Convex Procedure to linearize the concave part so
that the non-convex problem can be solved as a convex
problem. Then we use Newton’s Method to optimize the
transmit powers in problem (6).

proposed HRAIM scheme in terms of sum data rate of
all M-PVs and spectral efficiency. In the simulations, we
assume that the number of PVs in each cluster is 3, and the
distance between platoons is 30 m. Besides, we set the SINR
threshold γmin = 4 dB, the pathloss exponent α = 3, and
the AWGN power σ2 = −30 dBm.
Fig. 3 illustrates the effects of the number of platoons
and the value of individual maximum transmission power
on sum data rate of all M-PVs. Generally, when the number
of platoons increases, the sum data rate of all M-PVs grows.
The reason is that as the number of platoons grows, although
M-PVs need to share RBs with other M-PVs, the M-PVs can
use more RBs at the same time, and thus M-PVs can still
achieve a higher sum data rate. Meanwhile, Fig. 4 presents
that with different value of individual maximum transmission
power, the changes of spectral efficiency of all M-PVs as the
platoons number increases. We can observe that when the
number of platoons increases, the spectral efficiency rises.
This reason is that when we have more platoons, the increase
in the sum data rate of all M-PVs is greater than the increase
in the number of RBs, which contributes to the growth of

spectral efficiency. Specifically, when the number of platoons
is small, the spectral efficiency and the sum data rate of
all M-PVs are the same for HRAIM scheme and traditional
graph-coloring algorithm. This phenomenon is because that
M-PVs have fewer candidate RBs reusing pairs when there
are fewer platoons.
Fig. 5 displays the effects of the inter-vehicle distance and
the value of individual maximum transmission power on sum
data rate of all M-PVs. Generally, given a fixed number of
M-PVs (i.e., RBs), when the inter-vehicle distance increases,
the sum data rate decreases since the inter-vehicle distance
reduces the desired signal power gains. From Fig. 6, we
can observe that the spectral efficiency decreases with the
growth of inter-vehicle distance, since the reduced sum data
rate results in a lower spectral efficiency when the number
of RBs is fixed. Besides, when the inter-vehicle distance
increases, the spectral efficiency and the sum data rate of all
M-PVs are nearly the same for both HRAIM scheme and
traditional graph-coloring algorithm, since the advantage of
cumulative interference management becomes smaller when
the interference influence among M-PVs gets less.
V. Conclusions
This paper studied the joint optimization problem of
spectrum sharing and interference management in multiplatoon scenario. We assumed that L-PVs used the dedicated
RBs when transmitting messages to BS and broadcasting
their CAMs to their M-PVs, respectively. Meanwhile, MPVs reused the RBs with each other to forward their CAMs
to the adjacent M-PVs behind them. To maximize the
spectral efficiency, we transformed the resource allocation
problem into a hypergraph coloring problem. We proposed
a HRAIM scheme to select M-PVs based on their predefined
minimum SINR thresholds. Numerical results illustrated the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of spectral
efficiency and sum data rate.

Abstract—Platoon communications in vehicular networks is
considered to have broad application prospects in improving
road capacity and traffic safety. This paper considers a multiplatoon vehicle scenario, in which platoon vehicles (PVs)
transmit cooperative awareness messages (CAMs) to other PVs
in the same platoon. The leader platoon vehicles (L-PVs)
use dedicated resource blocks (RBs) to communicate with the
base station (BS) and broadcast their CAMs to their member
platoon vehicles (M-PVs). Meanwhile, to increase spectral efficiency and satisfy the communication demands of PVs, we allow
M-PVs to reuse RBs with each other to transmit their CAMs.
Finally, due to the fact that traditional graph can only model
pairwise relations, we utilize hypergraph to model relationship
among several users and propose a Hypergraph-based Resource
Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) scheme
for multi-platoon scenario. Simulation results illustrate that
the proposed scheme shows a better performance in terms of
spectral efficiency and sum data rate when compared with
traditional graph coloring algorithm and random selection
scheme.

I. Introduction
In vehicle-to-everything communications, platoon is considered to be one of the most representative fifth-generation
(5G) use cases, which can enhance traffic efficiency [1].
To support the synchronous control of the platoon, all
platoon vehicles (PVs) should maintain the same speed and
a constant inter-vehicle distance to ensure string stability [2]
[3], which makes the spacing and velocity error of platoon
would not be amplified with the downstream of the platoon. Therefore, it is essential to transmit their cooperative
awareness messages (CAMs) to other PVs. CAMs include
messages about the driving strategy of the platoon such
as speed and acceleration, as well as information about
resource scheduling within the platoon [1]. According to

communication structure of PVs, there are three main control
strategies, i.e., predecessor following control (PFC) strategy,
symmetric bidirectional control (SBC) strategy, predecessorleader following control (PLFC) strategy [4] [5]. Among
them, the PLFC strategy is a major approach, which shows
outstanding performance in improving string stability [5].
Specifically, each member platoon vehicle (M-PV) communicates with the leader platoon vehicle (L-PV) and the
adjacent PV in front of it to ensure string stability.
When PVs transmit their CAMs, they need to occupy
a certain amount of spectrum resources to realize predefined communication quality, e.g., the minimum data rate
requirements. In face of limited spectrum resources, reusing
spectrum is a promising way to enhance spectral efficiency,
which however introduces more interference among vehicles.
In this case, allocating spectrum resources reasonably is critical to improve communication delay and network capacity.
The authors in [6] jointly considered the platoon size and
power consumption of the platoon, and designed a twostep resource allocation strategy based on branch and bound
algorithm. Works in [7] proposed a time division-based
intra-platoon and minimum rate guaranteed inter-platoon
resource allocation mechanisms to allocate resources for
D2D users efficiently within the platoon. However, the joint
optimization problem of resource allocation and interference
management for multi-platoon scenario has not been well
studied.
The traditional graph can tackle the interference problem,
and the ordinary edges can model pairwise relations, which
however is not sufficient in modeling cumulative interference
in wireless networks. Hypergraph is a useful tool to tackle
this challenge, and it has been applied widely in recent
years [8] [9], since the hyperedges in hypergraph can take
into account the cumulative interference from several users.
Specifically, hypergraph coloring algorithm is an approximate and efficient method for resource allocation problem,
in which users can be modeled as vertices, and the interference relationship among multi-users can be constructed
as hyperedges, RBs can be constructed as different colors
[8] [10]. The authors in [11] used a weighted three-partite
interference hypergraph (IHG) to imitate the complex interference and put forward an IHG-based three-dimensional
matching resource allocation protocol. Meanwhile, works
in [12] proposed a hypergraph spectral clustering based

method in non-orthogonal multiple access heterogeneous
network to deal with the serious cumulative interference.
However, at the time of writing, there is no work invoking
the hypergraph coloring algorithm to address the resource
allocation problem in multi-platoon scenario.
Motivated by above discussions, this paper focuses on
resource allocation and interference management in multiplatoon scenario based on hypergraph coloring algorithm.
Main contributions are summarized as follows. Firstly, we
consider a multi-platoon scenario and formulate an optimization problem to maximize the spectral efficiency of
all M-PVs in the scenario. Then we propose a resource
allocation and interference management scheme for multiplatoon based on hypergraph coloring algorithm to solve the
problem. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the
proposed scheme in terms of spectral efficiency and sum
date rate.
II. System Model And Problem Formulation
In this section, we first describe the multi-platoon scenario along with the channel model. Then, we formulate a
general resource allocation problem to maximize the spectral
efficiency for the whole network.
A. System Model
We consider a multi-platoon scenario consisting of M
platoons on a fixed road segment, as shown in Fig. 1. The
i-th platoon is denoted by Vi. The number of PVs in each
platoon is the same, which is denoted by K, and the PVs
in Vi are denoted by Vi = {v1i, v2i, &hellip;, vji, &hellip;, vKi i}. Among
them, v1i is the L-PV and vji is the j-th PV of platoon Vi.
The licensed spectrum is divided into multiple RBs with
unit bandwidth, which can be reused by M-PVs. The MPVs reusing the same RBs are grouped into a cluster, and
the clusters are denoted by R= {r1, r2, &hellip;, rN}. Without
loss of generality, we apply the PLFC strategy in this work,
and give detailed discussions on its two main transmission
processes.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Broadcast process: Firstly, the L-PVs not only need
to receive the information from the BS, such as resource
scheduling messages, but also need to transmit their CAMs
to BS. The corresponding communication links are denoted
with red and orange dotted arrows in Fig. 1. Then L-PVs
broadcast their CAMs to their M-PVs. Due to the broadcast
range is limited, the L-PVs might not be able to cover the
entire platoon in the broadcast process.</li>
<li>V2V communications process: Once the process of the
broadcast is completed, each M-PV will start transmitting its
own CAMs to the adjacent M-PV behind it, the corresponding communication links are denoted with the blue arrow
in Fig. 1. We apply Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD)
mechanism so that M-PVs can transmit and receive CAMs
using different RBs simultaneously. Meanwhile, different
M-PVs can share RBs within controllable interference. By
assuming that each M-PV occupies a dedicated RB, they can
reuse the RBs of all members when they are grouped into
one cluster. For example, three M-PVs in the same cluster
can reuse three RBs simultaneously.
B. Channel Models
It should be noted that the broadcast process and V2V
communications process have different time periods, as
shown in Fig. 1, we mainly focus on resource allocation
and interference management in V2V communications process. We assume that the inter-vehicle distance of different
platoons is same, which is denoted by d0.

matrix, and the element of it, i.e., xi j,n, is given by

C. Problem Formulation
To maximize the spectral efficiency of all platoons with
the joint optimization of user clustering and resource allocation, we formulate the optimization problem as

In problem (6), the optimization variables are clustering
matrix XM×K×N and transmission power allocation matrix
PM×K. The total number of RBs used by all PVs is
M(K−2). Constraint (6b) indicates that the SINR of M-PVs
is no less than the minimum SINR requirement. Constraint
(6c) indicates that the transmission power of PVs should not
be larger than the maximum power. Constraint (6d) requires
that each M-PV can only be grouped into a cluster.
The optimization problem (6) is a maximum weighted
matching problem with nonlinear constraints, which is NPhard [13]. When there exist many PVs, exhaustive search
becomes unacceptable with high computational complexity.
Therefore, we propose a Hypergraph-based Resource Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) scheme to
solve the spectral efficiency maximization problem.
III. Hypergraph Based Resource Allocation
In this section, we will first give some preliminaries
about hypergraph theory and coloring algorithm, and then
construct a hypergraph for M-PVs. Finally, we introduce the
HRAIM scheme in detail.
A. Hypergraph Preliminaries
Here, we introduce several necessary definitions of hypergraph in the following [10].
Definition 1: A hypergraph H(X, E) is a vertex set X and
a set of edges E including hyperedges containing more than
two vertices and ordinary edges connecting two vertices.
Definition 2: In a hypergraph H(X, E), a strong deletion
of a vertex x ∈ X from H is to delete x from H and all the
edges containing x from E.
Definition 3: The monodegree of a vertex x is the maximum cardinality of a hyperedge subfamily E1(x) ⊆ E such
that two elements ei, ej ∈ E1(x), ei ∩ ej = x.
In Fig. 2, M-PVs constitute the vertex set, the interference
relationship among M-PVs constitutes ordinary edges set
and hyperedges set. Meanwhile, the set formed by edge 2
and edge 5 is the hyperedge subfamily of vertex x, and the
monodegree of x is 4.

edge 4 are ordinary edges. Edge 5 and edge 6 are hyperedges.
B. Interference Hypergraph Construction
We model M-PVs and the interference relationship among
several M-PVs as vertices and hyperedges, respectively. The
vertices in the same hyperedges represent that the cumulative
interference is so large that they cannot be grouped into
the same cluster. In other words, they cannot be colored
with the same color. As shown as Fig. 2, the M-PVs with
different circles represent that the M-PVs are in different
clusters. In the following, we establish the hypergraph with
the construction of ordinary edges and hyperedges.</li>
<li>Ordinary edges construction: For each vertex vji−1
reusing the same RB with another vehicle vls−1, if the SINR
of this vertex satisfies (7), then we connect two vertices with
an ordinary edge. As shown in Fig. 2, edge 1, edge 2, edge
3, and edge 4 are ordinary edges.

<li>Hyperedges construction: For each vertex vji−1
reusing the same RB with multiple vehicles, if the SINR
of this vertex satisfies (8), then we construct a hyperedge for
these vertices. As shown in Fig. 2, edge 5 and edge 6 are
hyperedges.

C. The Hypergraph-based Resource Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) Scheme for Multi-platoon
After constructing the hypergraph, we use hypergraph coloring algorithm to address the resource allocation problem.
In the coloring algorithm, the vertices in the same edge
should be colored by at least 2 colors. First, according
to the interference relationship among PVs, we establish
ordinary edges and hyperedges with (7) and (8) to construct a

hypergraph. Then, according to the constructed hypergraph,
we calculate the monodegree for each vertex, and label the
PV which has the minimum monodegree with fL, where L
is the total number of vertices. Next, we strongly delete this
vertex and then get a new hypergraph. Based on this new
hypergraph, we repeat these steps until all vertices are sorted
by their monodegree. Finally, we color these vertices according to F= {f1, f2&hellip;fL} in a color which is in the available
color set. Note that the available color set of a vertex contains
these colors not being used by all vertices in the same
edge. If the available color set is empty, this vertex remains
uncolored. We conclude the HRAIM scheme in Algorithm</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>In Algorithm 1, the computational complexity of step
1 and step 2 are O((MK)2) and O((MK)3), respectively.
From step 4 to step 9, we have a loop with MK iterations.
Since the computational complexity is O((MK)3) from step
4 to step 6, the total complexity from step 4 to step 9 is
O((MK)4). In summary, the computational complexity of
the proposed HRAIM scheme is O((MK)4).

γmin: the SINR threshold for M-PVs;
L: the number of M-PVs.

Until: All vertices are sorted by monodegrees.
10: According to the user order of label set F= {f1, f2&hellip;fL},
color the vertices in a color selected from the available
color set.
After using Algorithm 1, we can obtain the clustering
results for M-PVs, i.e., the M-PVs with the same color is
a cluster. Referring to [14], we can prove that in problem
(6), the optimization objective function can be decomposed
into the sum of a convex function and a concave function.
Then we use the Interior Point Method to transform the
inequality constrained convex optimization problem into an
unconstrained problem. Finally, for each cluster, we use the
Concave-Convex Procedure to linearize the concave part so
that the non-convex problem can be solved as a convex
problem. Then we use Newton’s Method to optimize the
transmit powers in problem (6).

proposed HRAIM scheme in terms of sum data rate of
all M-PVs and spectral efficiency. In the simulations, we
assume that the number of PVs in each cluster is 3, and the
distance between platoons is 30 m. Besides, we set the SINR
threshold γmin = 4 dB, the pathloss exponent α = 3, and
the AWGN power σ2 = −30 dBm.
Fig. 3 illustrates the effects of the number of platoons
and the value of individual maximum transmission power
on sum data rate of all M-PVs. Generally, when the number
of platoons increases, the sum data rate of all M-PVs grows.
The reason is that as the number of platoons grows, although
M-PVs need to share RBs with other M-PVs, the M-PVs can
use more RBs at the same time, and thus M-PVs can still
achieve a higher sum data rate. Meanwhile, Fig. 4 presents
that with different value of individual maximum transmission
power, the changes of spectral efficiency of all M-PVs as the
platoons number increases. We can observe that when the
number of platoons increases, the spectral efficiency rises.
This reason is that when we have more platoons, the increase
in the sum data rate of all M-PVs is greater than the increase
in the number of RBs, which contributes to the growth of

spectral efficiency. Specifically, when the number of platoons
is small, the spectral efficiency and the sum data rate of
all M-PVs are the same for HRAIM scheme and traditional
graph-coloring algorithm. This phenomenon is because that
M-PVs have fewer candidate RBs reusing pairs when there
are fewer platoons.
Fig. 5 displays the effects of the inter-vehicle distance and
the value of individual maximum transmission power on sum
data rate of all M-PVs. Generally, given a fixed number of
M-PVs (i.e., RBs), when the inter-vehicle distance increases,
the sum data rate decreases since the inter-vehicle distance
reduces the desired signal power gains. From Fig. 6, we
can observe that the spectral efficiency decreases with the
growth of inter-vehicle distance, since the reduced sum data
rate results in a lower spectral efficiency when the number
of RBs is fixed. Besides, when the inter-vehicle distance
increases, the spectral efficiency and the sum data rate of all
M-PVs are nearly the same for both HRAIM scheme and
traditional graph-coloring algorithm, since the advantage of
cumulative interference management becomes smaller when
the interference influence among M-PVs gets less.
V. Conclusions
This paper studied the joint optimization problem of
spectrum sharing and interference management in multiplatoon scenario. We assumed that L-PVs used the dedicated
RBs when transmitting messages to BS and broadcasting
their CAMs to their M-PVs, respectively. Meanwhile, MPVs reused the RBs with each other to forward their CAMs
to the adjacent M-PVs behind them. To maximize the
spectral efficiency, we transformed the resource allocation
problem into a hypergraph coloring problem. We proposed
a HRAIM scheme to select M-PVs based on their predefined
minimum SINR thresholds. Numerical results illustrated the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of spectral
efficiency and sum data rate.

Abstract—Platoon communications in vehicular networks is
considered to have broad application prospects in improving
road capacity and traffic safety. This paper considers a multiplatoon vehicle scenario, in which platoon vehicles (PVs)
transmit cooperative awareness messages (CAMs) to other PVs
in the same platoon. The leader platoon vehicles (L-PVs)
use dedicated resource blocks (RBs) to communicate with the
base station (BS) and broadcast their CAMs to their member
platoon vehicles (M-PVs). Meanwhile, to increase spectral efficiency and satisfy the communication demands of PVs, we allow
M-PVs to reuse RBs with each other to transmit their CAMs.
Finally, due to the fact that traditional graph can only model
pairwise relations, we utilize hypergraph to model relationship
among several users and propose a Hypergraph-based Resource
Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) scheme
for multi-platoon scenario. Simulation results illustrate that
the proposed scheme shows a better performance in terms of
spectral efficiency and sum data rate when compared with
traditional graph coloring algorithm and random selection
scheme.

I. Introduction
In vehicle-to-everything communications, platoon is considered to be one of the most representative fifth-generation
(5G) use cases, which can enhance traffic efficiency [1].
To support the synchronous control of the platoon, all
platoon vehicles (PVs) should maintain the same speed and
a constant inter-vehicle distance to ensure string stability [2]
[3], which makes the spacing and velocity error of platoon
would not be amplified with the downstream of the platoon. Therefore, it is essential to transmit their cooperative
awareness messages (CAMs) to other PVs. CAMs include
messages about the driving strategy of the platoon such
as speed and acceleration, as well as information about
resource scheduling within the platoon [1]. According to

communication structure of PVs, there are three main control
strategies, i.e., predecessor following control (PFC) strategy,
symmetric bidirectional control (SBC) strategy, predecessorleader following control (PLFC) strategy [4] [5]. Among
them, the PLFC strategy is a major approach, which shows
outstanding performance in improving string stability [5].
Specifically, each member platoon vehicle (M-PV) communicates with the leader platoon vehicle (L-PV) and the
adjacent PV in front of it to ensure string stability.
When PVs transmit their CAMs, they need to occupy
a certain amount of spectrum resources to realize predefined communication quality, e.g., the minimum data rate
requirements. In face of limited spectrum resources, reusing
spectrum is a promising way to enhance spectral efficiency,
which however introduces more interference among vehicles.
In this case, allocating spectrum resources reasonably is critical to improve communication delay and network capacity.
The authors in [6] jointly considered the platoon size and
power consumption of the platoon, and designed a twostep resource allocation strategy based on branch and bound
algorithm. Works in [7] proposed a time division-based
intra-platoon and minimum rate guaranteed inter-platoon
resource allocation mechanisms to allocate resources for
D2D users efficiently within the platoon. However, the joint
optimization problem of resource allocation and interference
management for multi-platoon scenario has not been well
studied.
The traditional graph can tackle the interference problem,
and the ordinary edges can model pairwise relations, which
however is not sufficient in modeling cumulative interference
in wireless networks. Hypergraph is a useful tool to tackle
this challenge, and it has been applied widely in recent
years [8] [9], since the hyperedges in hypergraph can take
into account the cumulative interference from several users.
Specifically, hypergraph coloring algorithm is an approximate and efficient method for resource allocation problem,
in which users can be modeled as vertices, and the interference relationship among multi-users can be constructed
as hyperedges, RBs can be constructed as different colors
[8] [10]. The authors in [11] used a weighted three-partite
interference hypergraph (IHG) to imitate the complex interference and put forward an IHG-based three-dimensional
matching resource allocation protocol. Meanwhile, works
in [12] proposed a hypergraph spectral clustering based

method in non-orthogonal multiple access heterogeneous
network to deal with the serious cumulative interference.
However, at the time of writing, there is no work invoking
the hypergraph coloring algorithm to address the resource
allocation problem in multi-platoon scenario.
Motivated by above discussions, this paper focuses on
resource allocation and interference management in multiplatoon scenario based on hypergraph coloring algorithm.
Main contributions are summarized as follows. Firstly, we
consider a multi-platoon scenario and formulate an optimization problem to maximize the spectral efficiency of
all M-PVs in the scenario. Then we propose a resource
allocation and interference management scheme for multiplatoon based on hypergraph coloring algorithm to solve the
problem. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the
proposed scheme in terms of spectral efficiency and sum
date rate.
II. System Model And Problem Formulation
In this section, we first describe the multi-platoon scenario along with the channel model. Then, we formulate a
general resource allocation problem to maximize the spectral
efficiency for the whole network.
A. System Model
We consider a multi-platoon scenario consisting of M
platoons on a fixed road segment, as shown in Fig. 1. The
i-th platoon is denoted by Vi. The number of PVs in each
platoon is the same, which is denoted by K, and the PVs
in Vi are denoted by Vi = {v1i, v2i, &hellip;, vji, &hellip;, vKi i}. Among
them, v1i is the L-PV and vji is the j-th PV of platoon Vi.
The licensed spectrum is divided into multiple RBs with
unit bandwidth, which can be reused by M-PVs. The MPVs reusing the same RBs are grouped into a cluster, and
the clusters are denoted by R= {r1, r2, &hellip;, rN}. Without
loss of generality, we apply the PLFC strategy in this work,
and give detailed discussions on its two main transmission
processes.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Broadcast process: Firstly, the L-PVs not only need
to receive the information from the BS, such as resource
scheduling messages, but also need to transmit their CAMs
to BS. The corresponding communication links are denoted
with red and orange dotted arrows in Fig. 1. Then L-PVs
broadcast their CAMs to their M-PVs. Due to the broadcast
range is limited, the L-PVs might not be able to cover the
entire platoon in the broadcast process.</li>
<li>V2V communications process: Once the process of the
broadcast is completed, each M-PV will start transmitting its
own CAMs to the adjacent M-PV behind it, the corresponding communication links are denoted with the blue arrow
in Fig. 1. We apply Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD)
mechanism so that M-PVs can transmit and receive CAMs
using different RBs simultaneously. Meanwhile, different
M-PVs can share RBs within controllable interference. By
assuming that each M-PV occupies a dedicated RB, they can
reuse the RBs of all members when they are grouped into
one cluster. For example, three M-PVs in the same cluster
can reuse three RBs simultaneously.
B. Channel Models
It should be noted that the broadcast process and V2V
communications process have different time periods, as
shown in Fig. 1, we mainly focus on resource allocation
and interference management in V2V communications process. We assume that the inter-vehicle distance of different
platoons is same, which is denoted by d0.

C. Problem Formulation
To maximize the spectral efficiency of all platoons with
the joint optimization of user clustering and resource allocation, we formulate the optimization problem as

In problem (6), the optimization variables are clustering
matrix XM×K×N and transmission power allocation matrix
PM×K. The total number of RBs used by all PVs is
M(K−2). Constraint (6b) indicates that the SINR of M-PVs
is no less than the minimum SINR requirement. Constraint
(6c) indicates that the transmission power of PVs should not
be larger than the maximum power. Constraint (6d) requires
that each M-PV can only be grouped into a cluster.
The optimization problem (6) is a maximum weighted
matching problem with nonlinear constraints, which is NPhard [13]. When there exist many PVs, exhaustive search
becomes unacceptable with high computational complexity.
Therefore, we propose a Hypergraph-based Resource Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) scheme to
solve the spectral efficiency maximization problem.
III. Hypergraph Based Resource Allocation
In this section, we will first give some preliminaries
about hypergraph theory and coloring algorithm, and then
construct a hypergraph for M-PVs. Finally, we introduce the
HRAIM scheme in detail.
A. Hypergraph Preliminaries
Here, we introduce several necessary definitions of hypergraph in the following [10].
Definition 1: A hypergraph H(X, E) is a vertex set X and
a set of edges E including hyperedges containing more than
two vertices and ordinary edges connecting two vertices.
Definition 2: In a hypergraph H(X, E), a strong deletion
of a vertex x ∈ X from H is to delete x from H and all the
edges containing x from E.
Definition 3: The monodegree of a vertex x is the maximum cardinality of a hyperedge subfamily E1(x) ⊆ E such
that two elements ei, ej ∈ E1(x), ei ∩ ej = x.
In Fig. 2, M-PVs constitute the vertex set, the interference
relationship among M-PVs constitutes ordinary edges set
and hyperedges set. Meanwhile, the set formed by edge 2
and edge 5 is the hyperedge subfamily of vertex x, and the
monodegree of x is 4.

edge 4 are ordinary edges. Edge 5 and edge 6 are hyperedges.
B. Interference Hypergraph Construction
We model M-PVs and the interference relationship among
several M-PVs as vertices and hyperedges, respectively. The
vertices in the same hyperedges represent that the cumulative
interference is so large that they cannot be grouped into
the same cluster. In other words, they cannot be colored
with the same color. As shown as Fig. 2, the M-PVs with
different circles represent that the M-PVs are in different
clusters. In the following, we establish the hypergraph with
the construction of ordinary edges and hyperedges.</li>
<li>Ordinary edges construction: For each vertex vji−1
reusing the same RB with another vehicle vls−1, if the SINR
of this vertex satisfies (7), then we connect two vertices with
an ordinary edge. As shown in Fig. 2, edge 1, edge 2, edge
3, and edge 4 are ordinary edges.

<li>Hyperedges construction: For each vertex vji−1
reusing the same RB with multiple vehicles, if the SINR
of this vertex satisfies (8), then we construct a hyperedge for
these vertices. As shown in Fig. 2, edge 5 and edge 6 are
hyperedges.

where Z is the set of M-PVs sharing the same RB with vji−1
in addition to vi
j−1.
C. The Hypergraph-based Resource Allocation and Interference Management (HRAIM) Scheme for Multi-platoon
After constructing the hypergraph, we use hypergraph coloring algorithm to address the resource allocation problem.
In the coloring algorithm, the vertices in the same edge
should be colored by at least 2 colors. First, according
to the interference relationship among PVs, we establish
ordinary edges and hyperedges with (7) and (8) to construct a

hypergraph. Then, according to the constructed hypergraph,
we calculate the monodegree for each vertex, and label the
PV which has the minimum monodegree with fL, where L
is the total number of vertices. Next, we strongly delete this
vertex and then get a new hypergraph. Based on this new
hypergraph, we repeat these steps until all vertices are sorted
by their monodegree. Finally, we color these vertices according to F= {f1, f2&hellip;fL} in a color which is in the available
color set. Note that the available color set of a vertex contains
these colors not being used by all vertices in the same
edge. If the available color set is empty, this vertex remains
uncolored. We conclude the HRAIM scheme in Algorithm</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>In Algorithm 1, the computational complexity of step
1 and step 2 are O((MK)2) and O((MK)3), respectively.
From step 4 to step 9, we have a loop with MK iterations.
Since the computational complexity is O((MK)3) from step
4 to step 6, the total complexity from step 4 to step 9 is
O((MK)4). In summary, the computational complexity of
the proposed HRAIM scheme is O((MK)4).
Algorithm 1: Hypergraph-based Resource Allocation and Interference Management Scheme for Multiplatoon
Input:
γmin: the SINR threshold for M-PVs;
L: the number of M-PVs.
Output: the clustering results XM×K×N.
1: Construct ordinary edges for each M-PV vji, based on (7);
2: Construct hyperedges for each M-PV vji based on (8).
3: Set k = L;
Repeat:
4: for vi
j ∈ Vi, 1 ≤ i ≤ M do
5: Calculate monodegree for vji based on the hypergraph;
6: end for
7: Find the vertex with minimum monodegree and label it
by fk;
8: Strongly delete the vertex and form a new hypergraph;
9: Set k = k − 1;
Until: All vertices are sorted by monodegrees.
10: According to the user order of label set F= {f1, f2&hellip;fL},
color the vertices in a color selected from the available
color set.
After using Algorithm 1, we can obtain the clustering
results for M-PVs, i.e., the M-PVs with the same color is
a cluster. Referring to [14], we can prove that in problem
(6), the optimization objective function can be decomposed
into the sum of a convex function and a concave function.
Then we use the Interior Point Method to transform the
inequality constrained convex optimization problem into an
unconstrained problem. Finally, for each cluster, we use the
Concave-Convex Procedure to linearize the concave part so
that the non-convex problem can be solved as a convex
problem. Then we use Newton’s Method to optimize the
transmit powers in problem (6).

proposed HRAIM scheme in terms of sum data rate of
all M-PVs and spectral efficiency. In the simulations, we
assume that the number of PVs in each cluster is 3, and the
distance between platoons is 30 m. Besides, we set the SINR
threshold γmin = 4 dB, the pathloss exponent α = 3, and
the AWGN power σ2 = −30 dBm.
Fig. 3 illustrates the effects of the number of platoons
and the value of individual maximum transmission power
on sum data rate of all M-PVs. Generally, when the number
of platoons increases, the sum data rate of all M-PVs grows.
The reason is that as the number of platoons grows, although
M-PVs need to share RBs with other M-PVs, the M-PVs can
use more RBs at the same time, and thus M-PVs can still
achieve a higher sum data rate. Meanwhile, Fig. 4 presents
that with different value of individual maximum transmission
power, the changes of spectral efficiency of all M-PVs as the
platoons number increases. We can observe that when the
number of platoons increases, the spectral efficiency rises.
This reason is that when we have more platoons, the increase
in the sum data rate of all M-PVs is greater than the increase
in the number of RBs, which contributes to the growth of

spectral efficiency. Specifically, when the number of platoons
is small, the spectral efficiency and the sum data rate of
all M-PVs are the same for HRAIM scheme and traditional
graph-coloring algorithm. This phenomenon is because that
M-PVs have fewer candidate RBs reusing pairs when there
are fewer platoons.
Fig. 5 displays the effects of the inter-vehicle distance and
the value of individual maximum transmission power on sum
data rate of all M-PVs. Generally, given a fixed number of
M-PVs (i.e., RBs), when the inter-vehicle distance increases,
the sum data rate decreases since the inter-vehicle distance
reduces the desired signal power gains. From Fig. 6, we
can observe that the spectral efficiency decreases with the
growth of inter-vehicle distance, since the reduced sum data
rate results in a lower spectral efficiency when the number
of RBs is fixed. Besides, when the inter-vehicle distance
increases, the spectral efficiency and the sum data rate of all
M-PVs are nearly the same for both HRAIM scheme and
traditional graph-coloring algorithm, since the advantage of
cumulative interference management becomes smaller when
the interference influence among M-PVs gets less.
V. Conclusions
This paper studied the joint optimization problem of
spectrum sharing and interference management in multiplatoon scenario. We assumed that L-PVs used the dedicated
RBs when transmitting messages to BS and broadcasting
their CAMs to their M-PVs, respectively. Meanwhile, MPVs reused the RBs with each other to forward their CAMs
to the adjacent M-PVs behind them. To maximize the
spectral efficiency, we transformed the resource allocation
problem into a hypergraph coloring problem. We proposed
a HRAIM scheme to select M-PVs based on their predefined
minimum SINR thresholds. Numerical results illustrated the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of spectral
efficiency and sum data rate.
